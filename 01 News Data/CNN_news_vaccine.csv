"1","Anal cancer rates and deaths are climbing in the US, study says","article","Anal cancer cases and deaths are rising dramatically in the United States, especially among older people and young black men, a new study says. Researchers examined trends in anal cancer cases over about 15 years, and identified about 69,000 cases of anal cancer and more than 12,000 deaths during this time. ""Our findings of the dramatic rise in incidence among black millennials and white women, rising rates of distant-stage disease, and increases in anal cancer mortality rates are very concerning,"" the study's lead author, Ashish A. Deshmukh, an assistant professor at UTHealth School of Public Health, said in a statement. ""Given the historical perception that anal cancer is rare, it is often neglected."" Distant stage disease is when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. From 2001 to 2015, cases of the most common type of anal cancer increased by 2.7% per year, while anal cancer death rates increased by 3.1% per year from 2001 to 2016. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, ""gives numbers to a trend that seems to be happening over the last decade,"" said Dr. Virginia Shaffer, a colorectal surgeon and associate professor in Emory University's Winship Cancer Institute. ""In that sense it gives us numbers to what we were already expecting."" Shaffer was not involved in the study. Cancer linked to HPV Anal cancer occurs where the digestive tract ends. It is different from colon or rectal cancer and most similar to cervical cancer.  The most common subtype of anal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, caused by human papillomavirus, known as HPV. Over 90% of cases of anal cancers are associated with HPV, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Screening for anal cancer has been implemented for some high-risk groups, but the study authors argue their findings suggest ""broader screening efforts should be considered."" But they also believe the increase in diagnoses isn't likely to be because of an increase in screening practices. Since the 1950s, there have been substantial changes in risk factors for anal cancer, including shifts in sexual behaviors and an increased number of sexual partners, according to the study, both of which increase the likelihood of contracting HPV. The emergence of the HIV epidemic, especially among men who have sex with men, may have also influenced anal cancer trends because HIV is a risk factor. There are other risk factors, too, such as having had cervical or vulvar cancer, having received an organ transplant or being a current smoker. Who's impacted by anal cancer? The study found anal cancer cases have increased significantly in people aged 50 and older. It might be because HPV vaccine guidelines are ""very narrow,"" Shaffer said, limiting protection for older adults. When the first HPV vaccine was introduced in 2006, it was approved for people ages 9 to 26, ""so these older adults were way past that cutoff when the vaccine came out,"" Shaffer said. ""That's a large number of people who missed out on getting the vaccine."" Anal cancer rates are also rising among young black men.  HIV also disproportionately affects young black men, the study authors said, and having HIV is a risk factor for anal cancer. The study also found the number of advanced-stage cases is rising. This could partly be because treatment for HIV has improved, Shaffer said, which means patients are living longer with compromised immune systems, and cancer may have progressed further by the time it's diagnosed. Stopping stigma There is still stigma around anal cancer.  ""Desperate Housewives"" star Marcia Cross opened up about her anal cancer diagnosis earlier this year to help destigmatize the disease, she said. ""I know that there are people who are ashamed,"" Cross told ""CBS This Morning"" in June. ""You have cancer. Should you then also feel like ashamed like you did something bad because it took up residence in your anus?"" Anal cancer has become ""pretty taboo,"" Shaffer said, ""I think because of some of the risk factors that have historically been known to be associated with it. ""If people are having symptoms they should see a doctor because I think a lot of people think, 'Oh, well it's just hemorrhoids,' and don't get things checked and that could potentially also mean that you don't get diagnosed until much, much later."" Anal cancer is preventable through HPV vaccination. The CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine one year apart for children ages 11 to 12 in the US. Young adults up to age 26 can be vaccinated as well; three doses are recommended for people 15 and older. The vaccine is most beneficial when administered at younger ages, before a person is exposed to HPV. But the CDC says adults ages 27 through 45 who have not been adequately vaccinated can make make a decision with their doctors about HPV vaccination. Adults older than 45 who had not been vaccinated are not advised to do so, since HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in that age group. To strengthen prevention efforts going forward, Shaffer said all people who qualify to be vaccinated should do so, and that the current vaccine guidelines should be studied to determine whether they can be expanded to other patients.

"2","Doctors offer free flu shots for migrants. CBP all but certain to say 'no'","article","A group of physicians has volunteered to vaccinate migrants against the flu for free, but US Customs and Border Protection is all but certain to say no to the offer.  ""We haven't responded, but it's not likely to happen,"" a CBP official told CNN. ""As a law enforcement agency, and due to the short term nature of CBP holding and other logistical challenges, operating a vaccine program is not feasible,"" according to a statement from the federal agency. The offer of a vaccination clinic came in a letter on November 5 to federal officials from seven doctors affiliated with Doctors for Camp Closure. ""We're disappointed and frustrated,"" said Dr. Luz Arroyo, who signed the letter and practices family medicine and psychiatry in Sacramento. ""But we're not going to give up that easily and will continue to request access."" The group, which formed about three months ago and has about 2,000 physician members, outlined a plan to first vaccinate 100 migrants, and then expand to vaccinate the majority of migrants. ""We implore you to allow our volunteer physicians to hold our requested influenza vaccination clinic,"" the doctors wrote. NBC News first reported the letter. In the 2018-2019 flu season, at least three children died of the flu while in CBP custody. An infectious disease expert and longtime adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that this year, the flu has started early and is well underway, and that one of the major circulating strains is Influenza B, which tends to hit children especially hard.  ""We have an early and very active influenza season already in the United States, and given the history of influenza and the illness and deaths caused by influenza last year, I'd think CBP would do everything it can to provide protection against influenza as quickly as possible,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. This isn't the first time doctors have asked CBP to vaccinate migrants against the flu. In August, a group of physicians from Harvard and Johns Hopkins wrote a letter to members of Congress stating that vaccination should be offered to all detainees ""promptly upon arrival."" The legislators forwarded the letter to federal officials. ""I would have thought that CBP would have addressed this over the summer and we would now have a system in place,"" said Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""Vaccination is not complicated. We conduct mass campaigns all the time."" The letters from both groups of physicians were sent to Kevin McAleenan, then acting director of the Department of Homeland Security, and Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. McAleenan has since left his post. In the first seven months of 2019, more than 600,000 migrants were apprehended crossing the US southwest border. CBP policy, rooted in legal agreements, aims to move both children and adults out of its custody within 72 hours. Government reports show, however, that both children and adults have been held for considerably longer than 72 hours in crowded conditions. ""The facilities in which they're detained could not be better designed for the spread of influenza,"" Schaffner said. When migrants leave CBP custody, they often go into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services and ICE, both of which ""have comprehensive medical support services and can provide vaccinations as appropriate to those in their custody,"" according to the CBP statement.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/health/flu-shot-migrants-cbp/index.html","2019-11-19T17:36:43Z","2019-11-19T17:36:43Z","2019-11-19T17:36:43Z","cnn","By Elizabeth Cohen, CNN Senior Medical Correspondent","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180124144125-03-flu-virus-story-body.jpg"
"3","Samoa declares state of emergency after measles deaths","article","Samoa has declared a state of emergency after several deaths linked to a measles outbreak, closing schools and placing restrictions on public gatherings.  Some 14 children under the age of five and one adult have died from the epidemic in the South Pacific island nation, the United Nations children's agency UNICEF confirmed Tuesday.  The Samoa Ministry of Health declared a measles outbreak on October 16, according to UNICEF, who said there had been more than 1000 suspected cases so far.  Schools have been temporarily shut and children under the age of 17 have been advised by government officials not to attend public gatherings to stop the spread of the disease, UNICEF said. Measles has seen a wide resurgence around the world -- in both high-income countries in the Americas and Europe and lower-income nations in Asia and Africa -- fueled in part by fear of and lack of access to vaccines, and complacency. Almost 350,000 measles cases were reported globally in 2018, according to UNICEF -- more than doubling from 2017. On Monday, Winston Peters, New Zealand's foreign affairs minister, said his country would send vaccination nurses and a medical assistance team of doctors and nurses to Samoa to support the country's immunization program.  ""On 15 November the Government of Samoa declared a State of Emergency as the numbers of people infected with measles continues to rise and the hospital system is under strain,"" Peters said.   ""Measles is highly contagious, and the outbreak has taken lives in Samoa. It is in everybody's interests that we work together to stop its spread,"" Peters said in a separate statement on Friday.  David Durrheim, conjoint professor at the School of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Newcastle in Australia, told CNN affiliate SBS News that Samoa has long had low levels of vaccination. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine to ensure herd immunity. Measles coverage in Samoa was 40% for the first dose of the vaccine in 2018 and 28% for the second dose, according to UNICEF.  ""This latest outbreak in Samoa shows us how important it (is) for vaccination programs to reach children with lifesaving vaccines all over the world,"" Robin Nandy, UNICEF's chief of immunization, told CNN in a statement.  ""We are alarmed that measles cases globally have increased in 2019. This has happened largely due to a combination of conflict, insecurity, a breakdown or interruption in services and mistrust of vaccinations,"" he added. In Tonga, another South Pacific nation, the Ministry of Health confirmed an outbreak of measles following the return of Tongan rugby players from New Zealand, where one player developed the illness.  In a report released on Wednesday, the ministry said 251 cases of confirmed or suspected measles have been identified.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/health/samoa-measles-emergency-intl-scli/index.html","2019-11-18T16:20:40Z","2019-11-19T11:47:56Z","2019-11-19T11:47:56Z","cnn","By Amy Woodyatt, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150210154413-vaccines-2-cfb-story-body.jpg"
"4","Flu is getting an early start in the US this season","article","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told doctors on a conference call this week that the United States is seeing more flu than is typical for this time of year.   ""Influenza is off to an early start,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University who was on the CDC call, which included members of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a group of hospitals that help the CDC assess the severity of the flu season. Thirty states are seeing flu activity -- for this time of year, that's the most states in a decade. Three states, California, Louisiana and Maryland, are seeing widespread activity, while seven states are seeing regional activity: Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Texas.  That means it's more important than ever to get a flu shot now, rather than putting it off. It's not too late, as the peak of the season is still ahead.     ""So far, the vaccine has been a good match to all the strains that are out there,"" Schaffner said.      Looking at the United States as a whole, CDC data shows more flu activity from September 29 to November 9 than in the same time period for six other flu seasons that CDC used as a comparison. Only one season in the comparison had more activity at this time of year: the unusually severe 2009 pandemic flu season that broke records.     When the flu starts early, it sometimes -- but not always -- portends a more severe season.     ""An early season could be a harbinger of a severe season, and we're all a little bit worried about that,"" said Schaffner, a longtime advisor to the CDC. ""It's a little like a train gathering steam -- if it starts early it may rumble down the tracks with more ferocity.""    The Southeast has been hit particularly hard, with 12 states in the region showing flu activity.     Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician in Atlanta, says flu has hit so early this year that many of her patients hadn't had a chance to get a flu shot yet.   ""This year, I had children testing positive for the flu in early October,"" said, Shu, medical editor of healthychildren.org, an American Academy of Pediatrics website. ""We don't usually see flu that early in the year.""     There are several strains of flu, and the predominant one so far this season is an influenza B strain. B strains tend to hit children particularly hard.      ""We are seeing more influenza B than we would expect this early in the season, and influenza B is particularly a problem for children. It's a concern we're seeing this much of it this early,"" said Dr. Evan Anderson, associate professor of pediatrics and medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, who was also on the CDC call this week.

"5","5 things to know for November 15: School shooting, impeachment, Gaza, Chile, plague","article","Those deadly bushfires are still raging in Australia, and now the country's biggest city, Sydney, may be facing a water shortage.  Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. California school shooting  A student walked into his Southern California high school yesterday, pulled a gun out of his backpack and shot five classmates, killing two, police say. It was the suspect's 16th birthday. The terror unfolded at Santa Clarita's Saugus High School in a matter of seconds, and when it was all over, the shooter turned the gun on himself. He remains in critical condition. A 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy died at a hospital. Authorities said they are looking into the suspected shooter's Instagram account, which was taken down after the shooting. It appears he may have posted a warning before the attack, but police want to determine who else had access to the account. 2. Impeachment investigation The next round of testimony in the impeachment investigation starts this morning. Up today: former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and the counselor for political affairs at the US embassy in Ukraine, David Holmes. Yovanovitch is a career diplomat who was abruptly pulled from Kiev last spring after a personal order from President Trump. House Democrats are hoping she can provide an insider account of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's shadow foreign policy. Holmes was the one who overheard President Trump ask the US ambassador to the EU about the status of ""investigations"" during a cell phone conversation in a Kiev restaurant. Meanwhile, it looks like Trump will make good on his promise to release a transcript of his first phone call with the Ukrainian President. The decision comes after weeks of internal White House debate about the wisdom of releasing details of the call.  3. Gaza ceasefire A ceasefire appears to have been reached between Israel and Gaza militants after 50 hours of cross-border fighting that started with Israel's targeted killing Tuesday of senior Islamic Jihad leader Baha Abu al-Ata. More than 450 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel during the flare of violence, and Israel retaliated with a series of airstrikes. One of those strikes killed eight members of a family in central Gaza, a tragic example of the human toll the ongoing conflicts in the area have wrought. The ceasefire may prove to be a political boon for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The death of an Islamic Jihad leader, plus Netanyahu's calls for political unity in the aftermath, may help him win back support after failing to form a government following September's general elections.  4. Chile Chile's Congress has reached an agreement to reform the country's constitution in response to weeks of violent political protests. Chilean Senate President Jaime Quintana said the new constitution will be ""a true social contract"" and ""100% democratic."" The protests began over a now-suspended price hike for subway tickets in Santiago but expanded to include various economic and social complaints. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has already promised several reforms to tackle these issues, including pension raises, affordable medical insurance, lower medicine prices and more stable electricity prices. Protesters, however, may see the concessions as being too little, too late. Many have demanded Pinera's resignation. 5. Plague This is the comeback absolutely no one in the world wants to see. Two people in China are being treated for the plague, as in the Black Death plague that wiped out 50 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Believe it or not, the plague regularly makes isolated appearances around the world. According to the World Health Organization, more than 3,200 cases and 584 deaths were reported worldwide from 2010 to 2015. About seven Americans a year catch some form of the plague. While here's no commercial plague vaccine, the disease can be treated with antibiotics (though some forms are far deadlier than others). Here's the real scary part: With close to 50,000 human cases during the past 20 years, the plague is now categorized by WHO as a re-emerging disease.

"6","Germany makes measles vaccination compulsory for children","article","Germany's parliament has voted to make measles vaccinations compulsory for children, with parents who fail to immunize their children facing fines of €2,500 ($2,750).  The Measles Protection Act, which the Bundestag approved on Thursday, requires all parents to provide evidence that their child has received two measles vaccinations before they are enrolled in school or kindergarten. Medical staff, daycare workers, teachers and workers at community facilities must also be vaccinated under the act, which is due to come into effect in March 2020, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health told CNN.  There has been a resurgence of measles -- a highly infectious viral illness that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes -- across the globe.  Symptoms of the illness -- which can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces -- may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots. Germany had registered 501 measles cases between January and mid-October 2019, according to the Ministry of Health.  Under the new law, parents will have to present a certificate to the educational institution proving their child has received both vaccinations. Parents who do not inoculate their children will face a fine of €2,500.  Daycare centers that admit unvaccinated children will also be charged, and children who are not vaccinated can be excluded from school, according to the ministry.  Measles has seen a wide resurgence around the world -- in both high-income countries in the Americas and Europe and lower-income nations in Asia and Africa -- fueled in part by fear of and lack of access to vaccines, and complacency.  Almost 350,000 measles cases were reported globally in 2018, according to the United Nations children's agency UNICEF -- more than doubling from 2017. Two doses of the vaccine are needed to protect against measles. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine to ensure herd immunity. According to the German Ministry of Health, although 97.1% of first-graders had received the first vaccination, rates are not as high for the second jab, meaning the country still hasn't reached the 95% quota.

"7","Every year, between 1,000 to 2,000 people get the plague  -- including about 7 in the US","article","The plague -- yes, that plague -- is back in the news. But it never really went away.  The same scourge that caused the Black Death in the Middle Ages  sickened two people in China with pneumonic plague this month. In May, a Mongolian couple died from bubonic plague after eating the raw kidney of an infected rodent. But there are almost certainly more than four cases in the world.  Anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 people get the plague every year, the World Health Organization reported. But that total is likely too modest an estimate, since it doesn't account for unreported cases.  Even by US standards, four cases is unusually low. An average of seven Americans get the plague every year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.  Where is the plague most common? The plague is an endemic disease (meaning it exists permanently) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru. A 2017 outbreak in Madagascar infected nearly 2,350 people and killed more than 200, WHO reported, though no major outbreaks have been reported since.  In the US, cases are clustered in rural areas in southwest states, like Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado (where plague-carrying prairie dogs canceled camping at a Phish festival outside Denver earlier this year).  How likely am I to become infected? The plague is still relatively uncommon, though your risk of contracting it might be higher depending on where you live.  There's a risk of human plague wherever humans and animals that contain the plague bacteria co-exist, WHO said.  According to a 2016 map, the possibility of plague exists on almost every continent, especially the western US, parts of Brazil, scattered areas in southeast Africa and large swaths of China, India and the Middle East. But unless you live among a great deal of wild, disease-carrying rodents, your odds of infection in the US are slim.  How do you get the plague?  That depends on the type. Bubonic plague, the more common form, is caused by bites from infected fleas. It's rarely transmitted between humans.  It's also possible to transmit by handling an infected animal's tissue, as in the case of the Mongolian couple.  Pneumonic plague is the more severe and highly contagious type. Any person infected with pneumonic plague, which originates in the lungs, can infect another person if they inhale droplets from a cough or sneeze.  What are the symptoms? Every form of the plague starts out similarly -- fever, chills, weakness, headache -- before diverging, according to the CDC. Bubonic plague manifests as painfully swollen lymph nodes, called ""buboes,"" which can open into pus-filled sores in advanced cases.  Pneumonic plague, since it originates in the lungs, can cause shortness of breath, chest pain and occasionally bloody mucous. It can eventually cause respiratory failure and shock, too.  Another form, septicemic plague, can kill skin and tissue, turning it black, particularly on fingers, toes and the nose.  Can I prevent the plague?  There's no commercial plague vaccine, the CDC said, but it can be treated with antibiotics. Bubonic plague is more easily treated than pneumonic plague, which is almost always fatal unless it's detected and treated early.

"8","Two people just got the plague in China — yes, the Black Death plague","article","Two people in China are being treated for plague, authorities said Tuesday. It's the second time the disease, the same one that caused the Black Death, one of the deadliest pandemics in human history, has been detected in the region -- in May, a Mongolian couple died from bubonic plague after eating the raw kidney of a marmot, a local folk health remedy. The two recent patients, from the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia, were diagnosed with pneumonic plague by doctors in the Chinese capital Beijing, according to state media Xinhua. They are now receiving treatment in Beijing's Chaoyang District, and authorities have implemented preventative control measures. Plague, caused by bacteria and transmitted through flea bites and infected animals, can develop in three different forms. Bubonic plague causes swollen lymph nodes, while septicemic plague infects the blood and pneumonic plague infects the lungs. Pneumonic -- the kind the Chinese patients have -- is more virulent and damaging. Left untreated, it is always fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). During the Middle Ages, plague outbreaks devastated Europe, killing around 50 million people. Since then, we've invented antibiotics, which can treat most infections if they are caught early enough -- but the plague isn't gone. In fact, it's made a recent comeback.   From 2010 to 2015, more than 3,248 cases were reported worldwide, including 584 deaths, according to the WHO. The three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. In the United States, there have been anywhere from a few to a few dozen cases of plague every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, two people in Colorado died from the plague, and the year before there were eight reported cases in the state. Having caused close to 50,000 human cases during the past 20 years, the plague is now categorized by WHO as a re-emerging disease. How do you get plague? Is it curable? According to the CDC, people usually get plague after being bitten by a rodent flea carrying the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Infected animals like cats and dogs can also infect their owners. The bacteria persists because low levels circulate among populations of certain rodents, the CDC says. These infected animals and their fleas serve as long-term reservoirs for the bacteria. A 2018 study suggested it's not just rats that are responsible -- the Black Death may have spread by human fleas and body lice. There is currently no effective vaccine against plague, but modern antibiotics can prevent complications and death if given quickly enough. However, a strain of bubonic plague with high-level resistance to the antibiotic streptomycin, which is usually the first-line treatment, was seen recently in Madagascar. Untreated bubonic plague can turn into pneumonic plague, which causes rapidly developing pneumonia, after bacteria spreads to the lungs. A recent report suggests that researchers are exploring a variety of approaches to develop an effective vaccine. Since different vaccine designs lead to different mechanisms of immunity, the authors conclude that combinations of different types might overcome the limitations of individual vaccines and effectively prevent a plague outbreak. How do you protect yourself from plague? Key steps for prevention of plague include eliminating nesting places for rodents around your home, sheds, garages and recreation areas by removing brush, rock piles, trash and excess firewood, according to the CDC. Report sick or dead animals to law enforcement or your local health officials, do not pick up or touch them yourself. If you absolutely must handle a sick or dead animal, wear gloves. Use insect repellent that contains DEET to prevent flea bites and treat dogs and cats for fleas regularly. Do not sleep with your pets as this increases your risk of getting plague.

Facts There are 14 different vaccines that are recommended for children between birth and age six, including those for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, influenza, measles, mumps and rubella.  For more than 100 years, there has been public discord regarding vaccines based on issues like individual rights, religious freedoms, distrust of government and the effects that vaccines may have on the health of children. Exemptions to vaccines fall into three general categories: medical, religious and philosophical. Median immunization coverage for state-required vaccines was approximately 94.3% for children entering kindergarten during the 2017-2018 school year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  As of July 2019, 45 states and the District of Columbia allow religious exemptions from vaccines, and 15 states allow philosophical (non-spiritual) exemptions. Timeline 1855 - Massachusetts mandates that school children are to be vaccinated (only the smallpox vaccine is available at the time). February 20, 1905 - In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the US Supreme Court upholds the State's right to compel immunizing against smallpox.  November 13, 1922 - The US Supreme Court denies any constitutional violation in Zucht v. King in which Rosalyn Zucht believes that requiring vaccines violates her right to liberty without due process. The High Court opines that city ordinances that require vaccinations for children to attend school are a ""discretion required for the protection of the public health."" 1952 - Dr. Jonas Salk and his team develop a vaccine for polio. A nationwide trial leads to the vaccine being declared in 1955 to be safe and effective. 1963 - The first measles vaccine is released.   1983 - A schedule for active immunizations is recommended by the CDC. March 19, 1992 - Rolling Stone publishes an article by Tom Curtis, ""The Origin of AIDS,"" which presents a theory that ties HIV/AIDS to polio vaccines. Curtis writes that in the late 1950s, during a vaccination campaign in Africa, at least 325,000 people were immunized with a contaminated polio vaccine. The article alleges that the vaccine may have been contaminated with a monkey virus and is the cause of the human immunodeficiency virus, later known as HIV/AIDS. August 10, 1993 - Congress passes the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act which creates the Vaccines for Children Program, providing qualified children free vaccines. December 9, 1993 - Rolling Stone publishes an update to the Curtis article, clarifying that his theory was not fact, and Rolling Stone did not mean to suggest there was any scientific proof to support it, and the magazine regrets any damage caused by the article.  1998 - British researcher Andrew Wakefield and 12 other authors publish a paper stating they had evidence that linked the vaccination for Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) to autism. They claim they discovered the measles virus in the digestive systems of autistic children who were given the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The publication leads to a widespread increase in the number of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children for fear of its link to autism.  2000 - The CDC declares the United States has achieved measles elimination, defined as ""the absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area."" 2004 - Co-authors of the Wakefield study begin removing their names from the article when they discover Wakefield had been paid by lawyers representing parents who planned to sue vaccine manufacturers.  May 14, 2004 - The Institute of Medicine releases a report ""rejecting a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism."" February 2010 - The Lancet, the British medical journal that published Wakefield's study, officially retracts the article. Britain also revokes Wakefield's medical license. 2011 - Investigative reporter Brian Deer writes a series of articles in the BMJ exposing Wakefield's fraud. The articles state that he used distorted data and falsified medical histories of children that may have led to an unfounded relationship between vaccines and the development of autism.  2011 - The US Public Health Service finds that 63% of parents who refuse and delay vaccines do so for fear their children could have serious side effects. 2014 - The CDC reports the highest number of cases at 667 since declaring measles eliminated in 2000. June 17, 2014 - After analyzing 10 studies, all of which looked at whether there was a link between vaccines and autism and involved a total of over one million children, the University of Sydney publishes a report saying there is no correlation between vaccinations and the development of autism.   December 2014 - A measles outbreak occurs at Disneyland in California. 2015 - In the wake of the theme park outbreak, 189 cases of measles are reported in 24 states and Washington, DC.  February 2015 - Advocacy group Autism Speaks releases a statement, ""Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated."" May 28, 2015 - Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin signs a bill removing the philosophical exemption from the state's vaccination law. Parents may still request exemptions for medical or religious reasons. The law goes into effect on July 1, 2016. June 30, 2015 - California Gov. Jerry Brown signs legislation closing the ""vaccine exemption loophole,"" by eliminating any personal or religious exemptions for immunizing children who attend school. The law takes effect on July 1, 2016. January 10, 2017 - Notable vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. meets with President-elect Donald Trump. Afterwards, Kennedy tells reporters he agreed to chair a commission on ""vaccination safety and scientific integrity."" A Trump spokeswoman later says that no decision has been made about setting up a commission on autism. August 23, 2018 - A study published in the American Journal of Public Health finds that Twitter accounts run by automated bots and Russian trolls masqueraded as legitimate users engaging in online vaccine debates. The bots and trolls posted a variety of anti-, pro- and neutral tweets and directly confronted vaccine skeptics, which ""legitimize"" the vaccine debate, according to the researchers. October 11, 2018 - Two reports published by the CDC find that vaccine exemption rates and the percentage of unvaccinated children are on the rise.  2019 - As of November 7, the CDC has confirmed 1,261 individual cases of measles in 31 states. January 2019 - The World Health Organization names vaccine hesitancy as one of 10 threats to global health in 2019. March 26, 2019 - Rockland County, New York announces the ""extremely unusual"" step of banning unvaccinated individuals under age 18 from public places. One week later, a judge puts a hold on that and prohibits the county from enforcing the ban. May 10, 2019 - Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signs legislation removing the philosophical exemption for the MMR vaccine from the state's school immunization requirements. May 24, 2019 - Maine Gov. Janet Mills signs a bill into law removing all non-medical exemptions to vaccinations. The law will take effect in September 2021, and schoolchildren who claim a non-medical exemption prior to the law taking effect will be allowed to attend school if their parent or guardian provides a written statement from a healthcare professional indicating they've been informed of the risks of refusing immunization. June 13, 2019 - New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs legislation that removes nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements. The law goes into effect immediately. September 4, 2019 - Facebook announces that educational pop-up windows will appear on the social media platforms when a user searches for vaccine-related content, visits vaccine-related Facebook groups and pages, or taps a vaccine-related hashtag on Instagram. September 9, 2019 - California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signs two bills that limit medical exemptions for vaccines of schoolchildren. October 4, 2019 - The Department of Health and Human Services announces that the US has officially maintained its measles elimination status of nearly two decades.

"10","How France is persuading its citizens to get vaccinated","article","In February this year, a holiday in paradise turned into a nightmare for one French family. Soon after their arrival in Costa Rica, their unvaccinated five-year-old son developed measles, the country's first case since 2014. The parents, also unvaccinated, tested positive for the virus too. They were believed to have brought it from France. Measles is more contagious than Ebola, tuberculosis or flu, it has no specific treatment, and it can be picked up from the air or from surfaces for as long as two hours after an infected person has come and gone. Because it's so infectious, health experts see it as an early warning sign that there's a problem with vaccination coverage. ""Measles is like a canary in the mine,"" says Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project and a professor of anthropology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  To protect a population from measles, she says, at least 95% of people need to be vaccinated -- a higher threshold than for most other infections. This means that if vaccination rates start falling, ""it's going to be the first to show its ugly head"". When last measured in 2017, Costa Rica had a vaccination rate of 96%  for the disease -- a clear sign that its people shouldn't have been at risk from each other. That same year, France's measles coverage stood at only 90%. This isn't surprising in light of the widespread concern about childhood vaccines in France. One in three French people think vaccines are unsafe -- the world's highest rate -- and nearly one in five believe they aren't effective -- second only to Liberia.  This is according to new data from the Wellcome Global Monitor, a worldwide poll of more than 140,000 people in 144 countries. Global trend France may be on the extreme end, but it's part of a global trend that has many health experts worried. Across the European Union, people are delaying or even refusing vaccines, contributing to a rise in disease outbreaks.  Between 2010 and 2017, over half a million French infants didn't receive a first dose of the measles vaccine. And last year, France was among the ten countries with the highest year-on-year increases in measles, with confirmed cases jumping from just over 500 in 2017 to nearly 3,000 in 2018. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), reluctance or refusal to vaccinate is now one of the top ten major threats to global health. Even people in high-income countries, with good healthcare systems, are dying from easily preventable diseases. More than 70 people died of measles across Europe in 2018 -- three of them in France. ""It's a tragedy for Europe that a child or an adult has died because of a preventable disease,"" says Patrick O'Connor, a team lead in WHO Europe's Vaccine-Preventable Diseases and Immunization program. ""We owe it to them to protect them."" A critical mass of unvaccinated people produces a wildfire effect, O'Connor adds. ""Next year it could be diphtheria, or a variety of things.""  In France, vaccine coverage rates exceed levels of trust -- people still vaccinate their children, even if they are skeptical. But the spike in measles shows that, for some diseases, coverage still desperately needs to improve. Medical scares Like many French parents, Priscille, a young mother who lives in Paris, says she is unsure about vaccinating her child. The 25-year-old doubts the effectiveness of injections, and is worried about damaging her baby's immune system. ""It's all about money for the pharmaceutical companies,"" she says  This lack of trust in vaccines, despite overwhelming evidence that they are safe and effective, can be traced at least in part to the French government's mishandling of a series of medical scares. A blood transfusion scandal rocked the country in the 1990s. In the previous decade, thousands of people had been given blood contaminated with HIV -- most of them before the link between blood, HIV and AIDS was fully understood. Many of those who received contaminated blood died. Global headlines screamed ""Transfusion of Death"" and ""Blood Scandal Ministers Walk Free"" as the world's media tracked it for nearly a decade.  On the heels of this scandal came reports from medical professionals who claimed to have developed multiple sclerosis after receiving the hepatitis B vaccine. Although there was no evidence of a link, the government suspended its school vaccination program and promised to investigate in a bid to calm public outcry. ""But suspending it also raised suspicions,"" says Larson.  Then in 2009, France ordered 94 million doses of H1N1 vaccine at a cost of almost 1 billion euros. By the time the bulk of the vaccines had been delivered, it was realised that the pandemic was less dangerous than initially thought. At the end of the vaccination campaign in January 2010, the government was trying to cancel or sell off its surplus supplies. The process led to an ""absolute, total breakdown of trust,"" Larson says. ""The public was angry at the WHO for what they thought was overinflation of the risk, angry at the government for having bought so much vaccine."" The percentage of people who were favorable towards vaccinations fell from 91% in 2000 to 61% in 2010, according to national health agency Santé publique France. By 2016 it had recovered somewhat, but only to 75%.  Social media fuels scare stories More recently, and as in many other countries, social media has enabled scare stories and misinformation about vaccines to spread fast. The Facebook group Info Vaccins France, for example, has a series of testimonies from parents saying their children either died or became seriously ill following routine inoculations.  Part of the problem is that if just one person in several million has an adverse reaction to a vaccine, their story will spread and inflate on social media with no wider context. Henri Joyeux, a former surgeon and an honorary professor of oncology at the University of Montpellier, has been a leading campaigner against injections containing aluminum. It's used in some vaccines to boost the immune response and make a vaccine more effective and long-lasting. Joyeux, who was nearly disbarred from the medical profession for his views against vaccination, launched a campaign against Infanrix hexa -- the six-in-one children's vaccine -- in 2016.  Vaccinations against some diseases -- like polio, diphtheria and tetanus -- are important, he says. But his complaint against Infanrix hexa is that it contains aluminium and formaldehyde, ""dangerous substances for humans and especially infants"". Infanrix hexa, he says, also contains ""the hepatitis B vaccine suspected of being linked to multiple sclerosis"". The scientific consensus -- across the European Medicines Agency, the Vaccine Knowledge Project, the UK NHS and others -- is that Infanrix hexa is safe.  ""There's a lot of pretty negative, discouraging and sometimes quite frightening material about immunization on websites,"" says Larson. In response, French health bodies have put out information on social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. They have funded YouTube videos like 'Nine bullshits on vaccines', which has had over 350,000 views in 18 months, and sometimes they engage directly in online chats. ""It is very important that communication around vaccination continues and is always present vis-à-vis fake news,"" says Sylvie Quelet, director of health promotion and prevention at Santé publique France. ""The battle is not won."" Making vaccines mandatory for attending school Véronique Dufour is the deputy chief physician of the Paris maternal and infant protection center. She says her job has become much easier since the government increased the number of mandatory vaccines in January 2018.  Previously, the three vaccines that were mandatory -- diphtheria, tetanus and polio -- had good immunisation rates of 95% or higher. But eight other vaccines, including measles, meningococcal C and hepatitis B, had only been recommended -- and coverage was lower. Now, unless they have a medical exemption, children need to have had all 11 of these vaccines to attend a state-run school. ""People are asking fewer questions. Very, very few are not vaccinated,"" Dufour says. Early signs are that confidence in vaccines is rising since the law change. A small study of parents with young children carried out in February this year found that 91% think vaccination is important for their children's health, and 87% think it is important for protection of the wider population. Both figures show a 5% increase since a similar study was carried out in June 2018. Vaccination rates have also increased. The percentage of babies receiving the first dose of meningococcal C vaccine rose from 39 % in 2017 to 76 % in 2018. In the same period, vaccination rates for hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV) and measles also modestly increased.  Mandatory vaccination is one of the most successful ways of increasing immunization rates, according to the WHO. Indeed, France is not the only EU member to mandate large numbers of childhood vaccines. Others include Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.  But the WHO warns that this approach can also provoke vaccine hesitancy -- ""not necessarily because of safety or other concerns, but due to resistance to the notion of forced vaccination"".  ""Taking away freedom of choice can easily appear authoritarian,"" says Jeremy Ward at the VITROME laboratory. In France's highly politicized environment, he says, this could prompt a minority who were previously hesitant to become rampantly anti-vaccine. There might also be an increase in the number of children being given medical exemptions, Ward adds, which are supposed to apply if a child is allergic to eggs or if their immune system is too fragile. ""There are doctors in France -- as in all other countries -- who provide fake medical exemptions."" Parents like Priscille plan to keep their children away from public nurseries and to send them to alternative schools that are outside the state education system.  ""I'm lucky because I don't work, so I don't have to put them in the crèche, so I have the choice over vaccines,"" she says. Cautious optimism Laws are relatively quick to change. Attitudes and behavior may take longer. Sitting in a café near Notre-Dame cathedral, the day after it was devastated by fire, pediatrician Sydney Sebban says doctors have to take the time to build trust with parents.  He starts to do this when they bring their babies in for the first time at 15 days old, and he asks them about vaccinations, alongside feeding and sleeping. It's a matter of listening to their questions, taking time and giving them quality information, he says. ""I say to them there is no product which has zero risk. It doesn't exist. People must think about side-effects of ibuprofen or antibiotics.""  He encourages the ","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/health/france-fighting-vaccine-skepticism-partner-intl/index.html","2019-07-03T08:29:52Z","2019-11-05T14:37:23Z","2019-11-05T14:37:23Z","cnn","By Alex Whiting, Mosaic","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190619121316-01-france-fighting-vaccine-skepticism-intl-story-body.jpg"
"11","Anti-vaxxers may be exploiting widespread religious exemptions, research suggests","article","An increasing number of parents in the United States are citing faith to avoid getting their children vaccinated, according to a new study -- even though no major religion opposes vaccination. Childhood shots have been proven safe and effective, and prevent millions of deaths each year. Just 15 states allow parents to opt out of them for philosophical or personal reasons. But new research suggests that anti-vaxxers may be finding a workaround: exploiting religious belief exemptions that are permitted in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics, the study analyzed data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and found that religious exemptions have been increasing since 2011 -- and were significantly more likely in 2017 than six years prior. Parents were more likely to claim religious exemptions for vaccines in states that didn't permit personal belief exemptions, according to the research. That suggests a ""replacement effect,"" according to Dr. Joshua Williams, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado. ""When you give parents two options in a state, personal belief and religious exemption, a very small percent of parents are actually opting for religious exemptions if given an alternative,"" he said. Religious belief exemptions surged 640% in one state One state in particular, Vermont, offers a striking look at how some parents seem to be avoiding vaccines. After eliminating personal belief exemptions in 2016, the state saw a 640% increase in the proportion of kindergarteners with religious vaccine exemptions, according to Williams' study. To qualify for a religious exemption in the state, parents are required to sign a short form confirming that they've read a two-page vaccine fact sheet and ""attest to holding religious beliefs opposed to immunizations."" When personal belief exemptions were allowed, 1 in every 200 students entered kindergarten each year with a religious vaccine exemption. But that number surged to almost 1 in 25 after Vermont changed its law, the researchers found. The overall proportion of kindergarteners with non-medical exemptions did decrease in the state, but Rupali Limaye, associate director for behavioral research at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Vaccine Safety, said ""the results of this study do suggest a replacement effect."" The data, she said, suggest that ""parents are choosing to use religious exemptions as a mechanism to avoid complying with vaccination laws."" The rise of religious exemptions is particularly interesting, she added, because the study notes a decline in the number of individuals who report a religious affiliation in the United States. According to a Pew Research Center report cited by Williams' research team, the percentage of Americans describing themselves as agnostic or atheist has been trending upwards, from 16.1% in 2007 to 22.8% in 2014. ""It may be that insular religious groups are growing more rapidly than secular communities or that they are increasingly falling victim to vaccine misinformation,"" the study noted. ""Yet the rise of religious exemptions in an increasingly secular society also questions whether the religious exemption category can still serve its intended purpose."" No major religions oppose vaccination While eliminating personal belief exemptions may decrease state exemption rates overall and improve community health, ""it may also obscure reasons parents exempt their children from vaccines and create possible stigma for religious traditions who support vaccines,"" said Williams, who described himself as a ""religious individual."" He said that policymakers could create ""stronger exemption policies that preserve transparency"" and noted that most religious vaccine exemptions were formalized more than half a century ago. All major religions, he emphasized, support vaccines. That support isn't new, either. Buddhist nuns, for example, are said to have practiced an early version of smallpox vaccination more than 1,000 years ago. One Jewish rabbi, writing in the 18th century, called immunization ""an act of eager religious devotion."" And the Vatican has consistently encouraged vaccines, even those developed using fetal-derived cell lines. Tread carefully on vaccine restrictions, experts say Asked whether some parents are using religious vaccine exemptions dishonestly, Limaye, the Hopkins expert, said that ""parents that hold strong beliefs about vaccination believe they are doing what is best for their child."" That means ""they will exhaust all options to ensure that their beliefs are upheld,"" she said. The best approach toward vaccines, then, ""is to engage with these parents that have concerns"" and build trust, Limaye said. Vaccine scientists need to be ""innovative,"" she added, because eliminating all exemptions could be seen as punitive, and ""may backfire and lead to less trust in the health care system."" Jessica Atwell, an epidemiologist who works alongside Limaye at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that opposition to removing personal belief exemptions entirely has been extreme and polarizing in hesitant communities. ""Having an escape valve may be very important,"" she said. A better approach, according to Atwell, may be to put stricter requirements and rules in place around nonmedical exemptions, so that they're ""very challenging to get, but still possible to get.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/health/religious-vaccine-exemptions-study/index.html","2019-11-04T11:45:55Z","2019-11-04T11:45:55Z","2019-11-04T11:45:55Z","cnn","By Arman Azad, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150210154413-vaccines-2-cfb-story-body.jpg"
"12","5 things to know for November 4: Impeachment, McDonald's, Airbnb, measles","article","It's the first full week of Movember. Also, NoShavember. Confused? Both focus on health -- and a lot more hair. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Impeachment inquiry The sound of silence may end up being this week's soundtrack for the House impeachment probe. All four White House officials scheduled to give depositions today won't show up, a source tells CNN. Three others -- including Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- who were due to be deposed this week plan to skip out, too. Still, Democrats seem undeterred by their subpoenas being ignored at the behest of the White House, with some saying it's time to take the proceedings to the public stage. Meantime, the whistleblower who filed the complaint at the center of the inquiry is willing to answer written questions from Republicans, their lawyer said. The questions, however, cannot seek to identify the whistleblower. 2. McDonald's The top exec of one of the world's most popular burger chains is out. McDonald's board found that Steve Easterbrook violated company policy and ""demonstrated poor judgment involving a recent consensual relationship with an employee,"" the company said. Easterbrook in an email to employees expressed regret and called the relationship ""a mistake."" Easterbrook had led McDonald's aggressive modernization plan, including adding digital menu boards and selling fresh beef burgers. But he also ran up against some tension with franchisees. Stepping in as president and CEO is Chris Kempczinski, the recent head of McDonald's USA. 3. Europe & the far-right Officials in two European countries took steps to push back against what they consider threats from the far-right. In Norway, a high-profile American white supremacist was arrested hours before he was due to give a speech at a far-right conference. Intelligence authorities considered Greg Johnson ""to be a threat, not because of what he could do but because of his hate speech and his previously expressed support for Anders Breivik,"" the right-wing terrorist who killed 77 people in 2011. Johnson said he's never supported Breivik's crimes and has ""always consistently condemned violence and terrorism."" In Germany, city councilors in Dresden declared a ""Nazi emergency"" after years of ""right-wing extremist, racist"" activity. The symbolic move has no legal consequences but aims to highlight the far-right threat, said an official in a swath of the country where anti-immigrant sentiment runs high.  4. Airbnb Airbnb may not be your go-to for that next big bash. The global online lodging marketplace announced it's banning ""party houses"" after five people were shot and killed at a Halloween party near San Francisco. CEO Brian Chesky tweeted that his company will expand screening of high-risk reservations, create a ""'party house' rapid response team"" and potentially remove anyone from its site who breaks the rules. Though the deadly party happened at a rental that forbade parties, it was advertised on social media and drew more than 100 people. The party problem is the latest test for Airbnb, which has been accused of skirting local laws and propagating overtourism.  5. Measles You know in the movies, when someone's memories get zapped away by some inexplicable fictional force? Turns out measles has a similar -- but very real -- trick up its sleeve. The virus can erase the immune system's memory, leaving us vulnerable to diseases we were previously protected against, two separate studies have found. Dubbed ""immune amnesia,"" researchers say measles can undo the protection vaccines provide, wiping out 11% to 73% of patients' protective antibodies. We're talking infections like flu or tuberculosis, so measles outbreaks can cause spikes in other illnesses. Surviving measles patients can regain the lost immunities -- but only by being re-exposed to the illnesses. Measles, of course, is easily preventable, with two doses making the vaccine 97% effective. BREAKFAST BROWSE Know the signs Country singer Chely Wright revealed she had a stroke a year ago, just after turning 48. She's speaking out now so we might all better recognize the signs. A Kenyan rookie beat a Kenyan superstar in the NYC marathon Joyciline Jepkosgei's goal was just to finish strong in her first-ever marathon. Her countryman, Geoffrey Kamworor, won the men's division. 'Houston, we have a cookie'  An oven -- and cookie dough -- just blasted off to the International Space Station for the very first time. Now, about that glass of milk ...

""We have a responsibility to keep people safe on our services -- whether from terrorism, bullying, or other threats,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in November of last year. ""Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms,"" according to Facebook's community standards. ""We do not tolerate this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook."" However, CNN's investigation calls these statements into question. Our investigation found Facebook sometimes allows users to stay on its platform even when they repeatedly violate Facebook's standards on bullying and harassment, and verbally abuse others in the most hateful and violent of ways. For example, the woman who received the message calling her the n-word and telling her to slit her wrists reported the message to Facebook. Facebook determined that the message violated its community standards, and that the sender was a repeat offender -- but still, the sender was allowed to stay on the platform until CNN started asking questions. ""It's horrific. It's mind boggling,"" said Andrew Marantz, author of a new book, ""Antisocial."" ""Facebook likes to call itself a community, and if they want to live up to that promise, at the very bare minimum they should try to protect people from stuff like this."" Even Zuckerberg says his company needs to do more. ""On bullying and harassment, we have a lot of work still to do,"" the Facebook CEO told reporters in May. 'I was scared'   Aisha Odom, who received the message with the n-word, agrees. Odom, a mother of three young children in Austin, Texas, has urged others on Facebook to get vaccinated to help protect people like her brother, who has Crohn's disease and can't receive certain immunizations. She thought she'd become accustomed to anti-vaxxer attacks, but in April, Odom logged into Facebook Messenger and read a message that made her feel physically ill. ""Can we immunize are [sic] babies from becoming ignorant n*****s like you?"" a user wrote to her, spelling out the n-word. ""You uneducated tw*t, here's something you need to learn...How to slice those wrists correctly. Kill yourself, kill your kids, kill your parents, kill them all."" The user then gave illustrated instructions on how Odom should slit her wrists. ""I didn't know if it was a threat. I was scared,"" Odom said. ""I called my husband and sent him a screenshot, and he was afraid, too."" Odom immediately reported the message to Facebook. Facebook determined that not only did the message violate Facebook's standards, but the user had violated Facebook's standards before, according to the Facebook spokesperson. The user's punishment: For 30 days, she wasn't allowed to send messages in Messenger, according to the Facebook spokesperson. Otherwise, she was allowed to continue participating and posting on Facebook as usual. Odom said she was ""flabbergasted"" that Facebook didn't do more. ""Calling someone a horrible racial slur and telling them to kill themselves is totally OK with Facebook,"" Odom told CNN. In August, four months after Odom reported the message, CNN sent it to Facebook and asked why the user wasn't removed from the platform. In September, Facebook removed the user's account. ""We investigated the account further and determined the account should be actioned,"" the spokesperson wrote to CNN in response. The spokesperson did not explain why Facebook didn't remove the user on its own. The spokesperson, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to make a Facebook executive available for an interview for this story. CNN's investigation  Our investigation began in March with a story about anti-vaxxers attacking vaccine advocates on Facebook. After that story published, the Facebook spokesperson asked CNN to send the content we'd collected while reporting our story. With permission from the recipients, CNN sent the spokesperson 65 pieces of content that vaccine advocates said they found offensive, including posts and comments, and direct messages. The spokesperson sent the comments to Facebook's community standards team, which found that 39 of those pieces of content, posted by 31 separate users, violated their community standards, most of them regarding harassment. Facebook removed only one of the users -- the one who wrote the message to Odom. The other users remain on the platform, even though they had violated Facebook standards. With permission from the recipients, CNN sent the 39 pieces of content to ethicists, lawyers and social media experts. ""Whoever sent these messages should be off social media forever. All of them,"" said Arthur Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics at the New York University School of Medicine. ""Can't Facebook do more to police this? They should."" ""This is absolutely harrowing,"" said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law who specializes in social media. ""Facebook can do much better."" Marantz, the book author, recalled a famous saying from Zuckerberg. ""Facebook is one of the most profitable companies in the world. They can move fast and break things. Why can't they move fast and repair things?"" he said. 'If these don't cross the line of civility, what does?'   When CNN asked why Facebook removed only one of the 31 users from the platform, the spokesperson gave two answers.   First, the spokesperson said Facebook couldn't identify the users, since for the most part CNN sent screenshots of the comments, and not links to them. The spokesperson did not explain how Facebook managed to identify the person who sent the message to Odom, but not any of the other users. The spokesperson also didn't explain why they were unable to identify the users, yet CNN was able to identify most of them, using information from the screenshots such as names, profile photos, place of employment and schools attended. Secondly, the spokesperson noted that Facebook generally does not remove someone for a single infraction of bullying and harassment standards. Instead, it takes multiple violations, or ""strikes."" ""We don't want people to game the system, so we do not share the specific number of strikes that leads to a temporary block or permanent suspension,"" according to a Facebook report, ""Enforcing our Community Standards."" ""The effects of a strike vary depending on the severity of the violation and a person's history on Facebook."" In addition to the user who sent the message to Odom, CNN's investigation found at least two users who said they had violated Facebook's standards before and yet were allowed to stay on Facebook. One user told CNN he'd been in ""Facebook jail"" seven times and the other said she'd been similarly penalized on Facebook ""pretty frequently."" When CNN pointed out that these two users were still on Facebook despite what appeared to be multiple strikes, the spokesperson responded that Facebook would launch ""a more thorough investigation"" into the users who wrote the violating content. Ethicists questioned why Facebook hadn't removed the users who made some of the most flagrantly abusive comments -- particularly ones that encouraged violence. ""Some of these deserve immediate banning,"" said Timothy Caulfield, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Alberta in Canada. ""If these don't cross some line of civility, what does?"" Caulfield and Caplan, the NYU ethicist, said it was especially important for Facebook to be tough on abuse by anti-vaxxers, since they could intimidate users who post facts about vaccines. They pointed to this year's measles outbreak -- the largest in 27 years with more than 1,200 cases, according to the US Centers for Disease Control Prevention. Experts say measles flourished in large part because of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media, particularly Facebook. ""The vaccine space is exquisitely sensitive in that highly vulnerable lives -- newborns, cancer patients, those with immune diseases -- are hanging in the balance,"" Caplan wrote in an email to CNN. ""Facebook should have no tolerance for or room for anti-vaxx zealots and kooks.  They need to be monitored or if reported, checked and then blocked and banned pronto.  Public health must override misinformation and threatening behavior in the domain of vaccines."" This year, Facebook took steps to decrease the influence of anti-vaccine misinformation. In March, the platform announced it would start lowering the ranking of groups and pages that spread such misinformation in its News Feed and Search options. In September, Facebook announced that educational pop-up windows will appear on the social media platforms when a user searches for vaccine-related content, visits vaccine-related Facebook groups and pages, or taps a vaccine-related hashtag on Instagram. The difficulty in detecting bullying    In January 2018, Zuckerberg set a challenge for himself: Fix Facebook. ""The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do -- whether it's protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. ""My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues. We won't prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools."" In a series of Community Standards Enforcement Reports, Facebook revealed the results of its efforts. For example, in the first three months of 2019, the social media platform took down 5.4 million pieces of content that violated its standards against child nudity and sexual exploitation of children. In nearly every case -- 99% of the time -- Facebook detected this content on its own without bei","https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/health/facebook-harassment-eprise/index.html","2019-11-01T10:55:20Z","2019-11-01T18:06:47Z","2019-11-01T18:06:47Z","cnn","By Elizabeth Cohen, CNN Senior Medical Correspondent","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191029122851-aisha-odom-portrait-story-body.jpg"
"14","Measles wipe immune system's memory of other illnesses, studies find","article","Measles can erase the immune system's memory, leaving us vulnerable to diseases we were previously protected against, new research has found. Two separate studies, published Thursday in the journals Science and Science Immunology, found that the highly contagious and potentially fatal measles virus can cause ""immune amnesia,"" removing antibodies that had protected patients from other illnesses. Researchers from the Harvard Medical School, who led the Science study, examined blood samples from children before and after getting measles. They found that the virus wipes out 11% to 73% of patients' protective antibodies, putting them at greater risk of viral and bacterial strains they were previously immune to. This means that measles can effectively undo the protection provided by vaccines against other infections like flu or even tuberculosis -- and measles outbreaks can thus cause spikes in other illnesses. ""Imagine that your immunity against pathogens is like carrying around a book of photographs of criminals, and someone punched a bunch of holes in it,"" said Michael Mina, one of the study's primary authors, in a Harvard Medical School press release. ""It would then be much harder to recognize that criminal if you saw them, especially if the holes are punched over important features for recognition, like the eyes or mouth."" Surviving measles patients do eventually regain these lost immunities -- but they need to be re-exposed to the illnesses to build up those defenses. It's as if you had to meet the criminals missing from your book all over again, one by one -- a long and risky process, during which you remain vulnerable to whatever these criminals want to inflict on you. ""The team showed for the first time that measles resets the human immune system back to an immature baby-like state with only limited ability to respond to new infections,"" said a press release from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, which contributed to the Science Immunology study. The virus can cause fever, cough, watery eyes, and a rash of red spots. These effects are more severe in people that already have more vulnerable immune systems, like malnourished children or those with preexisting immune deficiencies. The studies' findings also emphasize the importance of vaccines. Measles are easily preventable -- one vaccination dose is 93% effective at preventing the disease. Two doses, as recommended by most health authorities' guidelines, make the vaccine 97% effective. The measles vaccine protects the immune system's memory from being deleted by the virus in the first place -- and if a patient gets measles, they may want to get booster shots for all their previous vaccines, like hepatitis and polio, to mitigate the effects of immune amnesia, said the Harvard Medical School press release. Researchers already knew that measles affects the immune system, but these two studies confirm for the first time the mechanisms of immune amnesia. This year has seen measles outbreaks all over the world, even in places that had previously eliminated the virus. Just a few months ago, the United States experienced its largest outbreak since 2000, which was so severe experts feared the country would lose its measles elimination status. In August, four European countries lost their measles-free status when the disease made a comeback after being eradicated years ago. These recent outbreaks have been put down to the growth of the anti-vaccination movement, which has spread via social media and discourages parents from immunizing their children against measles and other diseases. Right-wing populist politicians including Italy's Matteo Salvini, who has promoted a bill removing mandatory vaccination for children, have also been influential in pulling the public away from scientific orthodoxy. In the US, outbreaks have largely been among children in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, whose parents have refused to vaccinate them.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/health/measles-amnesia-study-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html","2019-11-01T06:07:11Z","2019-11-01T09:11:37Z","2019-11-01T09:11:37Z","cnn","By Jessie Yeung, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502192608-measles-story-body.jpg"
"15","Researchers are paying people to be deliberately infected with the flu virus","article","It's widely accepted that the flu and the torrent of uncomfortable symptoms that come with it are to be avoided at all costs.  But a few selfless souls have signed up to get the the infection so that one day, perhaps none of us will have to endure it ever again -- and they get paid, too.  Scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases are infecting willing subjects with influenza A (the infamous H1N1 virus, which has caused pandemics) and closely monitoring their symptoms to better understand how the virus works and how to control it.  For a handsome sum of up to $3,300, 80 adult participants across four research facilities will receive a nasal spray with the virus and spend at least one week at an inpatient facility until they've stopped ""shedding"" the virus -- that is, potentially infecting other people.  As volunteers cough, heave, sleep and shiver, researchers hope to glean how levels of preexisting flu antibodies will impact the duration and severity of participants' flu symptoms.  The study runs now until May (the long end of a typical flu season) at vaccine research units at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Saint Louis University Center for Vaccine Development in Missouri, Duke University in North Carolina and Ohio's Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.  The flu can be fatal Understanding how the flu operates is vital to defeating it: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 36,400 to 61,200 people died from the flu in the United States between October 2018 and May 2019, and more than half a million people were hospitalized.  The flu can turn deadly when there are other infections involved, when it aggravates another health condition or when there's an overwhelming immune response to the infection. It's linked to serious complications including pneumonia, heart attack and sepsis.  Though annual flu vaccines aren't foolproof -- scientists and doctors can't be sure which strain will reign each flu season -- they're the best way to avoid the infection and stop its spread. Those infected with the flu can treat it with antiviral drugs that shorten its duration and severity.

"16","Facebook launches new tool to help you get health tests and screenings","article","Facebook has launched a new feature to help track what preventive health screenings might be recommended for you based on your age and sex. The tool, called Preventive Health, rolled out in the United States on Monday and focuses specifically on cardiovascular health, cancer screening and seasonal flu -- making recommendations such as when to get a cholesterol test or where to get a flu shot. Facebook partnered with the American Cancer Society, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to build the tool with the most up-to-date, accurate resources and information. ""We are looking at the number-one and number-two killers in America, which are heart disease and cancer, and we're also looking at seasonal illness, particularly flu in this case,"" said Dr. Freddy Abnousi, a cardiologist and head of healthcare research at Facebook. ""The majority problem that we're trying to solve is making sure that people have this information in their hand in a way that's consumer friendly,"" he said, adding that when he thinks about this new tool, he thinks about his father. ""He had blood pressure problems for a long time,"" Abnousi said about his dad. An instrument like the Preventive Health tool could help someone like Abnousi's father manage their cardiovascular health care with blood pressure screenings, for instance. ""My hope is that if this was around then, he would pull it up on his phone -- and though he's too proud to talk to me about it or maybe doesn't feel comfortable talking to a primary care practitioner about it -- he would be able to understand it on his own and realize that it's important enough for him to engage in it,"" Abnousi said. The Preventive Health tool, currently available only in the United States, can be accessed by either searching for it on Facebook or clicking on a promotion that might appear in newsfeeds. The tool then provides personalized recommendations for what you should consider as part of your preventive care for heart disease, cancer and seasonal flu. When you are provided with your personalized recommendations, which only you can see, you then have the option to learn more information; mark the recommendations as completed, if you already have done some of them; or set checkup reminders to schedule future tests. The tool itself also can be shared with friends to increase awareness of preventive care. Most of the preventive measures recommended by the health groups that Facebook worked with are covered by insurance, but it's important to keep in mind that ""not everybody actually has access to primary care across the country,"" Abnousi said. ""So we also wanted to help in the access logistics."" The Preventive Health tool offers a map of federally qualified health centers nationwide where anyone can go to get certain screenings, tests and other health care services, if they choose. The centers, located in underserved areas, provide services regardless of patients' ability to pay, and charge for services on a sliding fee scale. When it comes to seasonal illnesses, the Preventive Health tool also includes a way to find where flu shots are being offered, such as pharmacies, grocery stores and urgent care clinics. Only time will tell whether Facebook users actually engage with the tool -- especially since Facebook has recently faced privacy issues, including a hack last year that exposed information on nearly 50 million users of the social network. Yet with the Preventive Health tool, Facebook ensures that it will not have access to users' test results or any other health information. Rather, the tool only provides information on recommendations and where to access care, based on a user's age and sex. ""Any tests that you have done as a result of engaging with this information are completely outside of us. We don't engage in that or hear about it ever from the health care system,"" Abnousi said. ""Secondly, your use of the Preventive Health tool on Facebook is not visible to any other Facebook users."" He added that personal information about any activity in the Preventive Health tool is not shared with third parties, such as health organizations or insurance companies. Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer at the American Cancer Society, which helped develop the tool, said that he hopes it will improve cancer screening rates and public health nationwide. For some cancer types -- such as cervical, colorectal, lung and breast -- clinical trials have shown that screening to detect cancer early can reduce the risk of dying from that cancer. ""We all know that screening rates for cancer are not as high as they could be,"" Wender said. ""There's many, many people who've had a cancer death prevented because they've been screened -- but there's so many more who have lost their lives when a screening test might have helped, and so we need new ways to reach the public,"" he said. The new Preventive Health tool follows other Facebook public health initiatives launched recently. In June, Facebook debuted a blood donation feature in the United States to help users find places to donate blood in their area and be notified when a nearby blood donation may be in need. In September, a new feature rolled out on Facebook and Instagram to combat the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation. Facebook, which owns Instagram, launched educational pop-up windows on both platforms that appear when a user searches for vaccine-related content, visits vaccine-related Facebook groups and pages, or taps a vaccine-related hashtag on Instagram. In the future, there is a possibility that the Preventive Health tool could expand to other countries and include more resources on preventive care outside of cardiovascular health, cancer and seasonal illness -- but for now, Abnousi said they want to make sure that the tool as-is reaches an audience. ""We're going to spend the next six to 12 months really trying to understand whether people are engaging with this tool and whether it's helpful or not,"" he said. ""Once we figure that out is when we're going to start thinking about expansion.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/health/facebook-health-preventive-tool-wellness-bn/index.html","2019-10-28T17:01:13Z","2019-10-28T17:01:13Z","2019-10-28T17:01:13Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190612081218-sheryl-sandberg-facebook-coo-june-12-2019-01-story-body.jpg"
"17","Pennsylvania woman ordered quarantined over measles concerns","article","A Pennsylvania woman has been ordered quarantined after she was potentially exposed to measles, the first time the city ordered a quarantine in decades, according to a city spokesman.  Tamika Brown visited Lehigh Valley Health Network on October 12, during a time when people there may have been exposed to measles, according to a court petition. When she was notified of her possible exposure, she was informed that a vaccine could provide immunity, but did not show up to get the vaccine and did not prove immunity to the Allentown Health Bureau, the petition says.  The petition says Brown indicated she would not comply with the quarantine. In response, the Health Bureau went to court, and on Monday, Judge Edward Reibman ordered her to stay in her home until November 3, or until the Health Bureau decides that she is noncommunicable.  Brown is one of five people in the city to be directed to stay under quarantine due to measles concerns, Mike Moore, a spokesman for the city, said in a statement. Moore said that none of the five are currently displaying symptoms of measles. During her quarantine, the Allentown Health Bureau is responsible for providing Brown food and other necessities, the order states.  Allentown Health Bureau Director Vicky Kistler said it is the first time such a court order was issued in about two decades, according to Moore's statement.  CNN was not able to reach Brown.  The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in a statement that confirmed measles cases are up in 2019.

"18","Virus could be the cause of mysterious polio-like illness AFM, study says","article","Researchers found evidence of what might cause acute flaccid myelitis, known as AFM, a rare polio-like illness that affects children. According to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, a virus seems to be the culprit. Since the first cases were documented in 2012, scientists have debated how children get AFM, which can cause weakness and paralysis. Some thought the cause was an autoimmune disorder, while others suspected a virus. Until recently, evidence of a virus was only circumstantial and couldn't be found in 98% of AFM patients who had their spinal fluid tested, according to the study. Using a virus hunting tool called VirScan, scientists were able to examine the spinal fluid of patients for an immune response to enterovirus and to thousands of other viruses simultaneously. Using this method, the team confirmed the presence of antibodies for enterovirus strains D68 and A71 in nearly 70% of the 42 AFM patients that they tested. They did not find antibodies against any other virus. ""When there's an infection in the spinal cord, antibody-making immune cells travel there and make more antibodies. We think finding antibodies against enterovirus in the spinal fluid of AFM patients means the virus really does go to the spinal cord. This helps us lay the blame on these viruses,"" Dr. Ryan Schubert, a clinical fellow in neurology at the University of California, San Francisco and an author of the new study, said in an emailed statement.  Enteroviruses are common; they cause about 10 million to 15 million infections a year in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Typically, enteroviruses cause cold-like symptoms such as fever, runny nose and body aches, and recovery is easy. What's still unclear is why the virus strains are linked to paralysis in some children when they don't have the same impact on adults, and why fewer than 1% of infected children get AFM. The new research is consistent with other recent studies. A study published in August in the journal mBio used another method and found antibodies to enteroviruses in 11 of 14 AFM patients. ""It's always good to see reproducibility. It gives more confidence in the findings for sure,"" said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, a co-author on the study in mBio. ""This gives us more support of what we found."" He, along with Dr. Nischay Mishra, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, said in the study the virus most clearly implicated was D68, and that is where research investments should focus. ""We are very eager to understand why. It seems by the time a child hits adolescence, almost everyone has been exposed to this virus, we want to know why these very few kids develop this awful outcome,"" Lipkin said. ""There may be a genetic predisposition, we don't know. We also need to uncover another piece of the puzzle that is why there is this sort of periodic outbreak. It seems to be every other year. We don't understand a lot about how EV D68 circulates and we want to know more."" Another recent paper, published in October in the journal Pediatrics, also said that AFM was likely caused by viruses, including enterovirus. The studies aren't conclusive, though, and more research is needed. But ""because of the public health urgency of understanding the etiology of AFM"" it was important to publish these results, the current study authors said. AFM was first documented in 2012, and the number of cases has grown since then. The CDC says there have been nearly 600 cases since it began tracking in 2014.  For most patients with AFM, symptoms begin between August and October. There have been 20 confirmed cases in the United States in 2019. There is no proven treatment for AFM, but knowing how AFM starts can be a first step for scientists to develop better diagnostic tools and one day, perhaps, a vaccine to keep children safe.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/health/afm-acute-flaccid-myelitis-cause-study/index.html","2019-10-21T21:54:10Z","2019-10-21T21:54:10Z","2019-10-21T21:54:10Z","cnn","By Jen Christensen, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181112172537-polio-like-illness-underreported-deaths-afm-elizabeth-cohen-dnt-lead-vpx-00003704-story-body.jpg"
"19","Vaccine exemption rates among US kindergartners continue to climb, CDC says","article","There has been a small increase in vaccine exemption rates among kindergarteners in the United States, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The finding, published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Thursday, shows that rates of young children not receiving vaccinations against certain diseases, including measles, continued to climb in recent years.  For the 2018-2019 school year, the national percentage of kindergartners with an exemption from one or more required vaccines was 2.5%, which was a slight increase from 2.3% during the previous school year and 2.1% in the 2016-2017 school year, the report found. The percentage of kindergartners with an exemption from one or more required vaccines ranged from 0.1% in Mississippi to 7.7% in Idaho and Oregon, the report found. Nationally, among those vaccine-exempt kindergartners, only 0.3% had a medical exemption while 2.2% had a nonmedical exemption, according to the report. ""Measles outbreaks affecting school-age children across multiple states during the 2018-19 school year underscore the importance of both school vaccination requirements for preventing disease spread and school coverage assessments to identify pockets of undervaccination,"" the researchers wrote in the report.  Those recent measles outbreaks occurred even though the measles virus was declared eliminated from the United States in the year 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for greater than a year. Measles can be prevented with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR, according to the CDC. ""Although the overall percentage of children with an exemption increased slightly for the second consecutive school year, children with exemptions still represent a small proportion of kindergartners nationally and in most states,"" the researchers wrote. ""More importantly, in 25 states, the number of nonexempt undervaccinated kindergartners exceeded the number of those with exemptions."" The report noted that nonexempt students include those provisionally enrolled, in a grace period or otherwise without documentation of vaccination. A grace period refers to a set number of days during which a student can be enrolled and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or exemption, but provisional enrollment allows a student without complete vaccination or exemption to attend school while completing a catch-up vaccination schedule. In many states, nonexempt undervaccinated students are attending school in a grace period or are provisionally enrolled, according to the report. States with lowest and highest vaccine coverage The new report summarized vaccination coverage data on about 3.6 million kindergarteners during the 2018-2019 school year. The data was collected by state and local immunization programs in 49 states: all states except Alaska, for which data was not reported to the CDC.  The report also included vaccine exemption data on some 3.6 million kindergarteners in all 50 states.  Federally funded immunization programs collaborate with departments of education, school nurses and other school personnel to assess vaccination coverage and exemption status of children enrolled in public and private kindergartens and then to report that data to CDC.  The new report found that nationally, during the 2018-2019 school year, vaccination coverage among kindergartners for the two-dose MMR ranged from 87.4% in Colorado to at least 99.2% in Mississippi. The recommended coverage for MMR is at least 95%, according to the report. For the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine or DTaP, coverage ranged from 88.8% in Idaho to at least 99.2% in Mississippi, according to the report.  For the varicella or chickenpox vaccine, the report found that coverage ranged from 86.5% in Colorado to at least 99.2% in Mississippi. Nationally for the 2018-2019 school year, coverage among kindergarteners for those vaccines was: 94.7% for two doses of the MMR; 94.9% for the required doses of DTaP; and 94.8% for the varicella vaccine, according to the report. The report had some limitations, including that the data are based on documentation from schools so some children might not be included in the data, such as those who are homeschooled. More research is needed to directly compare regions or states -- since in the new report, comparability is limited due to variation in states' requirements, data collection methods and definitions of grace periods or provisional enrollment when it comes to vaccine requirements. ""Today's data reinforces that childhood vaccine coverage remains high,"" Ranee Seither in CDC's Immunization Services Division and first author of the report said in an email on Thursday. ""Most parents continue to protect their children from 14 vaccine preventable diseases. But while nationwide vaccination coverage is high, and even high in many states, we still see pockets of under-vaccinated communities,"" Seither said. 'Clusters of refusal overlap clusters of outbreaks' While the CDC regularly reports on statewide exemptions of vaccinations, the agency could better predict possible measles outbreaks -- or outbreaks of other infections -- that result from declining vaccine coverage by also examining vaccine exemptions on a more local level, such as by county or school, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, who was not involved in the new report. Hotez and his colleagues conducted their own county-level examination of non-medical vaccine exemptions across the United States, published last year in the journal Plos Medicine. That study found that the number of nonmedical ""philosophical-belief"" vaccine exemptions had risen between 2009 and 2017 in more than half of the 18 states that allowed such policy at the time: Arkansas, Arizona, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Utah. Overall that previous study showed ""at least 100 counties, including 14 urban counties, that are highly vulnerable to measles,"" Hotez said. ""Sure enough, measles erupted in seven of those 14 counties, so we wound up making the first good measles prediction map,"" he said. ""I would recommend instead that the CDC publish at least county or even school based exemption rates in addition to state-level exemptions, and they should do this on an annual basis."" Other research, published in the medical journal JAMA in 2016, has shown that states with philosophical exemptions had both higher rates of refusal and higher rates of disease ""Clusters of refusal overlap clusters of outbreaks,"" Saad B. Omer, a professor of global health and epidemiology and pediatrics at Emory University who led that separate research, told CNN last year. However, ""if it's difficult to obtain an exemption, then you have lower rates of refusal and lower rates of disease,"" he said.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/health/vaccine-exemption-rates-kindergarten-cdc-study/index.html","2019-10-17T18:01:45Z","2019-10-17T21:51:22Z","2019-10-17T21:51:22Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150210154413-vaccines-2-cfb-story-body.jpg"
"20","Australia expels Vietnamese tourist caught with raw pork in her luggage","article","Australian border officials kicked a Vietnamese tourist out of the country after they found 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of banned food products in her luggage, including a large amount of raw pork -- amid global concerns over swine fever.   The median baggage allowance for international flights is 23.5 kilograms (52 pounds), meaning almost half of the woman's packing was potentially made up of food products, including both raw and cooked meat, fruit, squid, eggs, pate and garlic.  ""The passenger, a 45 year old woman from Vietnam, had her visitor visa canceled for failing to declare an extensive cache of food concealed in her luggage, including over 4.5 kilos of pork,"" Minister for Agriculture Bridget McKenzie said in a statement. ""In the midst of what is potentially the biggest animal disease event the world has seen, it beggars belief that someone would deliberately attempt to bring pork meat past our border.""  The woman was flagged by border officials at Sydney airport and pulled aside for a check after she didn't declare any banned items to customs. She is the first tourist to have her visa canceled and be expelled from the country over a breach of biosecurity laws. She will be allowed to return in three years. ""We are watching you,"" McKenzie told reporters on Tuesday. ""She was detected by officials as someone of interest ... she went through the biosecurity questioning, she had not declared, and in her suitcase was 10 kilograms of a mixture of quail, squid, cooked pork products and the like, all of which pose a significant biosecurity risk to our country.""  Australia has in the past been devastated by pests and diseases that the native ecosystem has no protections against, and the country has heavy restrictions on what tourists can bring in.  In 2016, actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard made what appeared to be a grovelling public apology in a video produced by the Australian government after they were caught smuggling their two Yorkshire terriers into the country.  Checks have been ramped up amid an epidemic of African swine fever in many parts of the world, with China alone losing more than 100 million pigs as a result, devastating the world's largest pork market.  ""One quarter of the world's pigs will be dead by the end of this year from African swine fever which kills about 80% of the pigs it infects and there's no vaccine and no cure,"" McKenzie said earlier this month, after the disease was detected in East Timor, less than 700 kilometers (435 miles) from the country's northern coast.  ""Since we increased border checks we've been seizing 100 kilograms per week in illegal pork products. Between 5 November 2018 and 31 August 2019 over 27 tonnes of pork were intercepted on air travelers entering Australia.""","https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/australia-vietnam-pork-customs-intl-hnk-scli/index.html","2019-10-16T03:59:13Z","2019-10-16T03:59:13Z","2019-10-16T03:59:13Z","cnn","By James Griffiths, CNN","travel","TRAVEL","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191016101827-australia-pork-tourist-01-story-body.jpg"
"21","Climate crisis raises risk of more Ebola outbreaks","article","The climate crisis is going to raise the risk that Ebola will spread farther and reach areas previously unaffected by the virus, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The study found that the climate crisis will bring a 1.75 to 3.2-fold increase in the rate at which the deadly virus spills over from animals to humans by 2070. There will be an increased risk of more devastating outbreaks in areas of Africa that haven't seen outbreaks before under all of the climate warming scenarios the researchers looked at, including if humans cut their carbon emissions significantly or only slightly. Higher temperatures and slower social and economic development would lead to greater risk. In west and central Africa, where outbreaks have traditionally clustered, outbreaks would happen more frequently and spread farther, via airlines, to previously unaffected areas, the researchers suggested. Using the current network of airline flights in their model, the study suggests that there is a high risk of Ebola spreading to China, Russia, India, Europe and the United States. The first Ebola outbreak was identified in 1976 and there have been 23 outbreaks recognized since. There's still more research to be done on exactly how these outbreaks start, but scientists suspect Old World fruit bats that carry the disease may be at least in part be to blame. They also believe contact between humans, great apes and duikers -- a small brown antelope -- may be connected to these outbreaks. Ebola is a rare but deadly disease. It has no cure and there is no approved vaccine, although there is a concerted effort to create one. Health officials remain hopeful about an experimental vaccine that has been widely used in the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Researchers figure Ebola outbreaks will increase due to the environmental conditions brought by the climate crisis such as higher temperatures. Previous research has shown that climate can impact animals that carry the disease like fruit bats. If there is more rainfall -- something predicted with warming temperatures, for instance -- there will be more fruit for the bats to eat. More fruit means more bats, that will reproduce more and also come into contact with more animals as they come together to eat this food, further increasing the likelihood that humans will come into contact with them. Conversely, if it's a year with drought, another scenario possible with warming temperatures, farmers that can't grow enough to feed their families might have to venture farther into the forest for food, increasing the chances they will come into contact with the forest animals such as bats, that carry Ebola. Ebola will also likely spread due to the projected human population growth and the limited health care in the African region. The authors created a mathematical model to take these multiple factors into account and determine exactly how much more frequent outbreaks will be. Other studies have found that disease spread by animals, not just Ebola, will become more frequent due to the climate crisis and will make many more people sick. About two-thirds of human infectious diseases start with animals like mosquitoes -- and mosquitoes love a warmer and wetter climate. The climate crisis may already be a factor in the spread of some diseases. Studies of the recent rise of the mysterious superbug C. auris connect it to the climate crisis. In addition to the spread of Ebola, scientists predict higher temperatures will bring more cases of malaria, diarrhea, heat stress, heart defects, malnutrition and antibiotic resistant diseases. Ultimately, scientists believe the climate crisis could ""halt and reverse"" progress made in human health over the past century, experts say. The World Health Organization predicted that rising global temperatures could lead to many more deaths than the 250,000 deaths a year it predicted just five years ago.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/health/climate-crisis-ebola-risks/index.html","2019-10-15T15:07:00Z","2019-10-15T15:07:00Z","2019-10-15T15:07:00Z","cnn","By Jen Christensen, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190620185536-congo-ebola-outbreak-david-mckenzie-pkg-story-body.jpg"
"22","More than 4,000 people have died from measles in Congo this year","article","More than 4,000 people have died from a measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo this year, UNICEF, the United Nations' children's agency, said on Wednesday. There have been 203,179 cases of the preventable illness across the country, and nearly 90% of the 4,096 deaths were children under the age of 5.  ""The number of measles cases in DRC this year is more than triple the number recorded for all of 2018. The measles outbreak in DRC has become far deadlier than Ebola, which to date, has taken 2,143 lives,"" UNICEF said in a statement. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine to ensure herd immunity. In Congo, measles immunization coverage was only 57% in 2018, UNICEF said. ""We're facing this alarming situation because millions of Congolese children miss out on routine immunization and lack access to health care when they fall sick,"" said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF representative in DRC. ""On top of that, a weak health system, insecurity, community mistrust of vaccines and vaccinators and logistical challenges all contribute to a huge number of unvaccinated children at risk of contracting the disease."" UNICEF said it was scrambling to vaccinate more children against measles and rushing life-saving medicines to health centers to help prevent deaths. WHO said last month that it was working with the government in Congo and other groups to launch an emergency campaign to vaccinate 825,000 children. Measles is highly contagious, spreading through coughing and sneezing. Up to 90% of the people close to the infected person, who are not immune, will also become infected. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death, according to WHO. Congo is currently facing the world's second largest Ebola epidemic on record. Ebola is much less contagious, but has a fatality rate of more than 70%.  WHO reported in August that there had been almost three times as many measles cases in 2019 as had been reported by the same time in 2018. Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine had reported the highest numbers, and major outbreaks were ongoing in Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Philippines, South Sudan, Sudan and Thailand. The largest outbreaks are in countries with low measles vaccination coverage.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/health/congo-measles-deaths-intl/index.html","2019-10-09T20:41:50Z","2019-10-09T20:41:50Z","2019-10-09T20:41:50Z","cnn","By Katie Hunt, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502192608-measles-story-body.jpg"

"24","Three STDs reach all-time highs in the US, new CDC report says","article","Health officials are raising alarm about a rise in STDs across the United States. For the fifth consecutive year, combined cases of gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis have risen in the United States, according to a Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on Tuesday. ""Combined they total 2.4 million infections that were diagnosed and reported just in last year alone,"" said Elizabeth Torrone, a CDC epidemiologist who worked on the new report, adding that the combined number marks ""the most cases"" ever recorded since monitoring began in the United States. A rise in the prevalence and incidence of STDs can come with serious public health consequences and concerns, including infertility, drug-resistant gonorrhea and congenital syphilis, which can cause infant death. ""Yet not that long ago, gonorrhea rates were at historic lows, syphilis was close to elimination, and we were able to point to advances in STD prevention,"" Dr. Gail Bolan, director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention, wrote in the new report's foreword. ""That progress has since unraveled. The number of reported syphilis cases is climbing after being largely on the decline since 1941, and gonorrhea rates are now increasing. ""Many young women continue to have undiagnosed chlamydial infections, putting them at risk for infertility.""  Possible factors driving this rise in STD cases, which vary depending on where you live, include a surge in people getting tested and cases being diagnosed and reported. There's also a decline in people using condoms. The new report found that rates of reported cases tended to be highest among adolescents and young adults.  The new CDC report calls for federal, state and local agencies to employ strategies that reduce STD incidence and help to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal and infant health. ""STDs cause a significant burden to the health care system -- both in terms of direct medical costs for treating STDs as well as the personal cost for people who have an STD,"" Torrone said. ""As the STD epidemic continues to grow in the United States, the direct medical costs and the quality of life lost will just increase as well."" Where cases are highest and lowest Four STDs are monitored nationwide and nationally notifiable to the CDC: chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and chancroid.  The states with the highest rates of cases were: Alaska for chlamydia 
Mississippi for gonorrhea 
Nevada for primary and secondary syphilis  For each of those three diseases, rates in the District of Columbia were higher than all states. ""We've seen increases like the nation as a whole has seen increases. We've seen some recently bigger jumps and there's a number of factors to which we attribute that,"" said Michael Kharfen, senior deputy director of the HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and TB Administration at the DC Department of Health, who was not involved in the new CDC report. One factor includes that testing services have been more easily accessible, which likely led to a large prevalence of cases being identified, Kharfen said. The DC Department of Health is continuing to invest in screening and testing efforts.  ""We have been very aggressive in making STD screening available in lots of different both clinical and community settings, particularly among young people, who have a disproportionate number,"" he said.  The new report, which analyzed STD data for the year 2018, found that a total of about 1.8 million cases of chlamydia infection were reported to the CDC last year, making it the most common notifiable condition in the United States. Last year, rates of chlamydia cases by state ranged from 198.2 cases per 100,000 people in West Virginia to 832.5 cases per 100,000 people in Alaska, according to the new report. The rate for the District of Columbia was 1,298.9 cases per 100,000, the report found. The report also found that a nationwide total of 583,405 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC last year, making it the second most common notifiable condition in the United States.  Rates of reported gonorrhea climbed 82.6% since a historic low in 2009, the report found. In 2018, rates of reported gonorrhea cases by states ranged from 43 cases per 100,000 people in Vermont to 326.7 per 100,000 in Mississippi, according to the report. The gonorrhea rate in Washington, DC, was 611 cases per 100,000 people, the report found. The report also found that 115,045 cases of syphilis nationwide were reported to the CDC last year. In 2018, states' rates of reported primary and secondary syphilis cases ranged from 1.8 per 100,000 people in Vermont to 22.7 per 100,000 in Nevada. The rate of reported primary and secondary syphilis cases in DC was 40.2 cases per 100,000. Among other STDs included in the report, there has been overall declines in reported chancroid cases, in the prevalence of herpes simplex virus infections and in the prevalence of the human papillomavirus or HPV-related complications such as genital warts, which may be due to having access to a HPV vaccine, according to the report. 'The most tragic consequences of this growing epidemic' There has been a concerning rise in congenital syphilis cases, increasing each year since 2013, according to the report. Congenital syphilis is a severe, disabling and often life-threatening infection that occurs in infants when a pregnant mother who has syphilis spreads the disease through the placenta to her baby.  ""One of the things that really stands out in this new report is the new and updated data on congenital syphilis, which is one of the most tragic consequences of this growing epidemic,"" Torrone said. The STD surveillance report for the year 2017 found that cases of congenital syphilis have more than doubled since 2013. The new report found that last year there were 1,306 cases of congenital syphilis among newborns reported to the CDC. ""Most concerning in that overall case count -- there were 94 infant deaths related to congenital syphilis,"" Torrone said. ""All of those cases could have been prevented if pregnant women had been treated appropriately and in a timely way prior to delivery,"" she said. ""We really need to make sure that all pregnant women are screened at their first prenatal care visit, treated appropriately and that their partners are treated so that we prevent reinfection."" 'We have a real threat with drug resistance' As the United States sees these steep increases in STDs, there also has been a slow decline in treatment options for one infection in particular: gonorrhea. The threat of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea persists across the United States and around the world. There have been a growing number of gonorrhea cases that are resistant to some of the antibiotics used to treat the infection. Last year in the United Kingdom, a man was infected with a multidrug-resistant form of gonorrhea that was resistant to first-line treatment, a combination of the antibiotics azithromycin and ceftriaxone, according to Public Health England. The man had to be treated intravenously with the antibiotic ertapenem. ""With gonorrhea in particular, we have a real threat with drug resistance,"" said Dr. Mark Mulligan, chief of infectious diseases at NYU Langone Health in New York and director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center, who was not involved in the new CDC report. ""For most gonorrhea, we're down to a single drug and if we lose that it could potentially become untreatable,"" he said. ""One need is to develop new antimicrobials for resistant organisms like gonorrhea. Another need or another strategy to combat the much broader problem of antimicrobial resistance is using vaccines to try to prevent the infections and therefore reduce the impact of drug resistance."" Why STDs are on the rise The report had some limitations, including that the data only included STD cases that had been reported to the CDC. ""In order for a case to be represented in the report, the infection actually needs to be diagnosed and reported,"" CDC's Torrone said. ""We know that there are many more infections that occur that just are not getting diagnosed and treated,"" she said. ""The intervention that we need is really to be able to increase access to routine screening as well as quality prevention."" While the report documents the burden of these infections in the United States, it doesn't pinpoint why rates are increasing -- but Torrone had some ideas. ""I think it's important to remember that part of the increase in cases is because we're actually doing a good job getting people screened,"" Torrone said, but the ""steep and sustained increases"" in cases are unlikely explained by just increased screening alone. ""Some of that increase in incidence may be due to change in sexual behaviors,"" she said, such as decreases in people using condoms.  For instance, results from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance, published last year by the CDC, found that among sexually active high school students, the prevalence of using a condom during a recent sexual experience increased from 46.2% to 62.8% between 1991 and 2005 but then decreased from 62.8% to 53.8% between 2005 and 2017. Condom use among men who have sex with men has also decreased, past research found. Socioeconomic factors also can influence whether someone gets tested and treated in a timely manner. The National Coalition of STD Directors said in a statement on Tuesday that ""steep increases in STDs are largely due to federal, state, and local funding cutbacks."" In 2012, for instance, 52% of state and local STD programs experienced budget cuts, amounting to reductions in clinic hours, contact tracing and screening for common STDs, according to the CDC. ""We have an STD crisis in the US because prevention programs were sold short for years,"" David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said in the statement.  ""Our first line of defense is underfunded and overwhelmed, leaving Americans vulnerable to STD outbreaks, and that's exactly what we're seeing,"" he said. ""STDs have real health and human costs. Babies dying from preventable conditions, like congenital syphilis, is not an outcome we can accept. This is a heartbreaking symptom of our nation's STD crisis. Without a radical shift in how we prioritize sexual health in the United States, we can only expect things to get worse."" The coalition -- as part of the Partnership to End the HIV, STD, and Hepatitis Epidemics -- called for Congress to increase funding for CDC's STD prevention services by $70 million. The coalition also called for the US Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that its Federal Action Plan on sexually transmitted infections, announced earlier this year, is finalized and implemented urgently. The proposed release for the STI Federal Action Plan is 2020.

"25","Most pregnant women aren't getting flu and whooping cough shots, CDC warns","article","Most pregnant women in the United States don't get flu and whooping cough vaccines even though the shots are safe and recommended as part of routine prenatal care, a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday. The report said the low rates of vaccination during pregnancy could put moms-to-be and newborns at greater risk of infection, hospitalization and death. The two vaccinations pass on antibodies to the fetus that provide protection after birth, when babies are too young to be vaccinated. It added that pregnant women have more than double the risk of hospitalization if they get influenza compared to women of childbearing age who aren't pregnant, the CDC said.  The CDC surveyed nearly 2,100 women ages 18 to 49 who were pregnant any time between August 2018 and April 2019. They found that 54% had reported getting a flu shot and 55% said that had received Tdap -- the vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, which is known as whooping cough. It said that only 35% had received both vaccinations.  ""Obstetricians and midwives are on the front line of care for expectant mothers and are the most trusted source of vaccine information for their pregnant patients,"" said Dr. Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer in CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. ""We encourage them to start discussing the importance of maternal vaccination early in pregnancy, and continue vaccination discussions with their patients throughout pregnancy.""  ""Influenza and pertussis, or whooping cough, are serious infections that can be deadly for babies,"" Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director, told reporters Tuesday. In infants, whooping cough can lead to episodes of coughing that last for weeks. ""Parents may see their babies gasping for air and even turning blue from lack of oxygen,"" Schuchat explained. It can also lead to vomiting after coughing fits and more serious complications such as pneumonia and seizures, experts say.  Since 2010, up to 20 babies have died each year from whooping cough in the United States, according to the CDC. The CDC recommends that all pregnant women get a flu vaccine during any trimester of each pregnancy and the whooping cough vaccine during the early part of the third trimester of each pregnancy. Women whose health care providers offered or referred them for vaccination were more likely to report receiving the vaccinations. About three-quarters of pregnant women said they had been, but of those, roughly a third remained unvaccinated. The survey also found that black women had lower vaccination rates than women of other races and were less likely to say they had received an offer or referral for a vaccination from their health care provider.  The top reason for not getting the Tdap vaccine was not knowing it was needed for each pregnancy. The top reason for not getting vaccinated against influenza was the belief the vaccine wasn't effective. The next most common reason for not receiving either vaccine was safety concerns for the infant -- despite both vaccines having a strong track record of proven safety. The CDC said the flu shot lowers a pregnant woman's risk of hospitalization by an average of 40%. Since 2010, among women ages 15 to 44 years who were hospitalized for influenza, 24% to 34% of them were pregnant -- even though only approximately 9% of US women in this age group are pregnant at any given time each year. Maternal vaccination also reduces the risk of hospitalization from influenza in babies younger than 6 months by an average of 72%, the report said. In infants younger than 2 months, the Tdap vaccination is 77.7% effective in preventing whooping cough cases and 90.5% effective in preventing hospitalizations.

"26","Flu season is here and now is the time to get a flu shot","article","The aches, the sneezing, the sore throat, the exhaustion -- flu season is here and you want to be prepared. Typically, the ""season"" starts in October, but there has already been flu-related deaths reported. Physicians say it's not too early to get a flu shot and they are available at many pharmacies and doctor's offices around the country.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people get a flu vaccine by the end of October, if possible.Doctors say you definitely want to one before Thanksgiving, when you are likely to see more people, travel and be exposed to more germs. It typically takes about two weeks to build up your immunity once you get the shot.   Last year's flu season For the 2018-2019 US flu season, which started October 1, 2018, and ended May 4, preliminary numbers from the CDC estimate there were nearly 42.9 million cases of flu, up to 647,000 hospitalizations and up to 61,200 flu deaths. It wasn't a typical flu season, experts said. The severity was moderate, the CDC reported, but it was record-breaker as the longest flu season in a decade. ""Last year was funny in a way,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, National Foundation for Infectious Diseases medical director and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""We had an unprecedented event with one virus dominating the season early on, then it abated, then another strain came along, making this a double-barrel season that we hadn't seen before and also making it rather prolonged."" Predicting the flu this year  For this year, the ""crystal ball is very cloudy,"" about how bad it will be, but flu season is ""not good for anyone,"" Schaffner said -- especially for the very young,  pregnant women, the elderly and people with chronic conditions. All are vulnerable to the worst effects of the flu.  ""One sure thing about influenza is, where and how it will spread or what kind of season we will have, it is unpredictable,"" said Dr. Daniel B. Jernigan, the director of the influenza division at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, a division of the CDC. ""The more we know, the more we know you can't figure it out very well."" Jernigan said the CDC has increased the number of viruses it tests for and it works with scientists from all around the world to track them. Using sophisticated artificial intelligence and modeling they can characterize where the virus is going and what kind of virus it will be to some extent. But it's not easy, since the virus changes every year as it moves through the population.  The virus also can change within a season as it moves from country to country. Looking at how bad a flu season was in Australia, which has winter when the United States has its summer, is not necessarily predictive of what the flu season will be like in the US, Jernigan said.  ""This virus continues to be elusive,"" Jernigan said.""While we don't have a clear idea, we do know flu is going to be here and the best way to prevent it is to get a vaccine."" ""We get on our soapbox and remind people that everyone older than 6 months needs to be vaccinated every year,"" said Schaffner.  Get your flu vaccine It's not a perfect vaccine because there are a number of flu strains that circulate, but it does provide some protection. If you happen to get sick, the vaccine cuts down on how long your symptoms last and it should protect you from the major complications that come with the flu, such as pneumonia. ""What the vaccine does is shift the equation in our favor,"" said Schaffner.  This year, nasal spray is an option for some patients, including children who may not like getting a shot. In some years, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended children stick with a shot, as some studies showed it was more effective. There is no such suggestion this year. The time get the shot is now Schaffner adds that if you have a chronic disease such as diabetes or asthma or heart disease, the flu shot should be a part of your regular care. In that case, you are the kind of patient that the flu makes very sick and you are at highest risk for hospitalization and death. The flu can also put you more at risk to have a heart attack or a stroke. With some older people, doctors might recommend they get the vaccine in the middle or end of October, because their immunity could wane toward the end of the season. But Dr. David Cennimo, an infectious disease specialist and assistant professor in the department of medicine at Rutgers University, said he usually tells his patients to get it whenever they can. ""If they are really concerned about the potential for the vaccine to wane over six months, they may want to wait a few weeks but you really don't want to go beyond middle October or the end of October, because of the risk of exposure to flu in your area,"" said Cennimo.  What else can you do to avoid the flu?  There are ways to avoid the flu.  Repeatedly washing your hands can help protect you this flu season. Flu germs tend to linger and hand washing can cut down our exposure.  Avoid friends and family members that are sick.  And for the sake of those around you, stay home from work or school if you are sick. Rest will help you get better and staying home can protect people around you.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/health/flu-season-what-to-expect/index.html","2019-10-07T11:09:22Z","2019-10-07T11:09:22Z","2019-10-07T11:09:22Z","cnn","By Jen Christensen, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110190501-universal-flu-vaccine-story-body.jpg"
"27","CDC anticipates US will maintain its measles elimination status","article","With the end of the New York state measles outbreak, ""the United States anticipates maintaining its measles elimination status,"" a statement from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. There are no longer any active measles cases in New York state associated with the outbreak that began in October 2018, the New York State Department of Health said Thursday. More than 42 days have passed without any new measles cases in New York's Sullivan and Orange counties, the statement said, and outbreaks in Rockland County and New York City also ended recently. ""The threat, however, for vaccine-preventable diseases remains and the Department is not letting down its guard,"" New York state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a statement Thursday, adding that there are responses underway in Nassau, Monroe and Putnam counties, which have measles exposures related to international travel. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the United States, meaning it was no longer continuously transmitted in the country. The World Health Organization removes a country's elimination status when measles has been spreading continuously for one year. Losing that elimination status would be a black eye on the United States, public health experts have said. ""The end of the New York state measles outbreak is a credit to the great work by local and state health departments, community and religious leaders, and other partners,"" the CDC's Thursday statement said. ""However, this outbreak is a grave reminder that we need heightened vigilance around measles as well as other vaccine preventable diseases, and we continue to address the myths and misinformation driving these outbreaks. CDC continues to encourage parents to speak with their family's healthcare provider about the importance of vaccination. We also encourage local leaders to provide accurate, scientific-based information to counter misinformation. Vaccines remain the most powerful tool to preserve health and to save lives. The CDC reported this week that there were 1,243 cases of measles in the United States in 2019. Cases have been confirmed in 31 states. The majority of cases were among people who were not vaccinated against measles, and more than 75% of cases were linked to outbreaks in New York.  The number of cases this year marks the greatest number reported in the United States since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/health/measles-elimination-status-bn/index.html","2019-10-03T16:23:54Z","2019-10-03T16:23:54Z","2019-10-03T16:23:54Z","cnn","By Jamie Gumbrecht and John Bonifield, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190606220134-01-measles-womens-event-story-body.jpg"

Calhoun County officials received confirmation Wednesday that a Battle Creek resident died from EEE complications. With such a high concentration in Michigan, officials scheduled aerial pesticide treatments for Wednesday night for parts of the state. Residents were able to opt out of the pesticide spray. This year has seen an unusual uptick in the number of reported cases and deaths. Typically, there are only five to 10 human cases reported in the US each year, with about 30% of all cases resulting in death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. EEE is a rare virus spread through mosquitos. The illness can cause brain swelling preceded by flu-like symptoms, including a high fever, chills and nausea. Severe cases can result in seizures or a coma that can cause brain damage, the CDC said. In addition to the Michigan deaths, three people have died in Massachusetts, three in Connecticut and one person has died in Rhode Island. ""Before this year, we have had only one human case of EEE in Connecticut, and that was in 2013,"" Dr. Matthew Cartter with the Connecticut Health Department said. A vaccine for EEE is on the market for horses, but not for humans. There have been six confirmed cases among horses in Connecticut this year. Lt. Gov.

""Based on an incorrect report filed by a hospital, DPH has been notified that the fourth death was improperly reported and the official death count remains at three people,"" the state reported in a statement Thursday. Massachusetts health officials also announced the addition of a 12th case of the disease, a woman in her 70s from Hampden County. There have also been three deaths in Michigan, two in Connecticut and one in Rhode Island. Eastern equine encephalitis, known as EEE, is a rare virus transmitted by mosquitoes. There are typically only 5 to 10 human cases reported in the United States each year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 30% of all cases result in death. This year there has been an uptick in the number of reported cases, nearly 30 among several states. Tests also confirmed an 11th human case of the mosquito-borne virus in Massachusetts. The patient is a man in his 70s who lives in Worcester County. With this latest infection, Massachusetts elevated several more communities to high risk. The communities of Auburn, Charlton, Dudley, Leicester, Southbridge and Spencer are now included in the 46 communities considered to be at high risk. There are also 35 communities at critical risk and 122 at moderate risk. EEE virus has been found in 422 mosquito samples in Massachusetts this year, according to the department, many in species that are capable of spreading the virus to humans. The mosquitoes can also infect animals. There is a vaccine for horses who get EEE, but there is no vaccine for humans.  ""Although mosquito populations are declining at this time of year, risk from EEE will continue until the first hard frost,"" said State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine Brown. ""We continue to emphasize the need for people to protect themselves from mosquito bites."" Massachusetts has done some aerial spraying to kill mosquitoes, but the state is done for this season. The spraying helps reduce the risk of EEE, but the risk will persist until that first hard frost. The health department encourages people to wear long pants, socks and long sleeves to reduce the amount of skin exposed to the bugs. Use bug spray and limit outdoor activities to an hour before sunset up until dawn. That's when the bugs bite the most.

"31","Only half of Americans plan to get a flu shot this year. Here's why that's a problem","article","While 60% of adults think that the flu vaccine is the best preventive measure against flu-related deaths and hospitalizations, only 52% said they planned to get one this season, according to a survey by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID). NFID and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington on Thursday to talk about the survey and to encourage Americans to get vaccinated against this potentially deadly disease. ""Make no mistake: the flu is a serious, but impactable health challenge,"" said US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. ""I'm here because the mission of HHS is to protect and enhance the health and well-being of every American, and one of the easiest ways to do that each year is for everyone over 6 months of age to get a flu vaccination."" Flu vaccine effectiveness can vary, studies show, reducing the risk of illness between 40% and 60% among the overall population when the vaccine is well-matched to the virus strains that are circulating during a particular flu season. But even if you get sick, a flu shot will reduce the number of days you are sick and drastically lower the chances you will be hospitalized or die from flu. Even after people have recovered from their illness, the inflammation that accompanies the disease puts people at greater risk for heart attack and stroke, even weeks after their flu symptoms have gone away. Describing flu vaccination and prevention as ""important public health causes for the entire Trump Administration,"" Azar walked through the numbers from a survey NFID conducted about flu vaccination rates and attitudes in August. The NFID survey of more than 1,000 people found that there was an increase in the number of children who were vaccinated against the flu: almost 63% got it in the 2018-2019 flu season, an increase of nearly 5% from the flu season before. ""The flu vaccination coverage was greater for children than for adults. Pediatricians drive this message home,"" said Dr. Patricia Whitley-Williams. Whitley-Williams is the NFID president-elect, and a professor of pediatrics and division chief of allergy, immunology and infectious diseases at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.  ""But 63% is not acceptable. We can, and we must, do better,"" she said. Children are at high risk for getting the flu and if they get a flu shot, it dramatically lowers the chances they'll spread the virus to other students and to the adults who interact with them. ""Dispelling those myths with the parents has been important,"" Whitley-Williams said. ""Some parents tell me they worry [they're] going to develop the flu from it and that is just not true."" ""With the danger of getting the flu, especially flu related complications, it is just devastating to have a healthy child one day and then see them dying in the ICU from flu, which is totally preventable,"" Whitley-Williams said. She compared getting a flu shot to using a child's car seat.  ""You wouldn't drive off with a child that was not restrained in a car seat,"" Whitley-Williams said. ""No good parent would do that. Why would you not vaccinate your child against the flu?"" Older people account for most flu-related hospitalizations, yet only 68% of long-term care workers who interact with that high-risk population got a flu shot. That's low compared to the overall estimated rate among health care workers: 81% said they had their shot last flu season. Looking at the number of children who died from the flu between 2010 and 2016, only 22% were fully vaccinated, Azar said. ""We know the flu vaccination can be life-saving in children,"" Azar said. For the 2018-2019 US flu season, which started October 1, 2018 and ended May 4, 2019, preliminary numbers from the CDC estimate there were up to 42.9 million cases of flu, up to 647,000 hospitalizations and up to 61,200 flu deaths. The top reason people said they did not get a flu vaccine: 51% surveyed said they didn't think it worked, 34% said they were concerned about side effects and 22% said they were concerned they'd get the flu from the vaccine. Azar added some adults say they don't like needles. ""When does it start?"" Azar asked, joking after he was given a flu shot at the press conference. ""Painless."" ""It's not perfect, but it's still critical that we emphasize the importance of even this partial protection,"" of the flu shot, said Dr. William Schaffner, the NFID medical director. Schaffner is a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""We need to remember, even if you get influenza after receiving the vaccine you are likely to benefit by having a less severe and shorter illness and you are less apt to have complications,"" Schaffner said.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/health/who-gets-flu-shot/index.html","2019-09-26T19:43:57Z","2019-09-26T19:59:07Z","2019-09-26T19:59:07Z","cnn","By Jen Christensen, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161130100221-seven-questions-about-the-flu-shot-00000405-story-body.jpg"
"32","Here's how to protect yourself (and your pets) from EEE, the deadly mosquito-borne virus","article","A 10th person has died from Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a rare mosquito-borne illness.  It's the fourth Massachusetts resident to die from EEE, which can cause brain swelling, in 2019. Previous deaths occurred in Connecticut, Michigan and Rhode Island.  This year's EEE outbreak has been particularly severe, with 27 human cases of the virus in six states since August.  Several animals, mostly horses and goats, have gotten the virus, too.  A Mexican gray wolf pup died at a Michigan zoo last week after an EEE diagnosis, though officials said it was rare for canines to contract the illness.  If local health officials have issued EEE warnings for your county, don't panic. Here's how to keep your family, including its furrier members, safe from the virus.  Go heavy on the repellent  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends EPA-approved mosquito repellents, particularly those that contain DEET, a powerful active ingredient in many repellents, or the oil of lemon eucalyptus.  Luckily, it's quite rare for domestic animals like cats and dogs to be diagnosed with EEE (it's named for its prevalence in horses, after all). It's still possible though, so ask your veterinarian for a repellent approved for animal use.  Unless you have a stable of horses, you can't get an EEE vaccine. The only EEE shot is made exclusively for equines.  Stay indoors between dusk and dawn As the days grow shorter, it gets increasingly difficult to beat the sunset. But Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor and expert in mosquito-borne illnesses, encourages people to try: Mosquitoes are most active in the dark, so it's best to stay indoors then and avoid them entirely.  Try telling that to a pet that urgently needs to use the restroom. If an animal needs to relieve itself or play outside at night, it's best to keep them on a deck or patio that's screened in -- it keeps mosquitoes out.  But mosquitoes can still strike while the sun's up. The pests are attracted to shade, he said, so be aware of any buzzing while you retreat from the heat.  If you want to sit on your porch past sundown, Telford suggests firing up a powerful fan or two -- he says mosquitoes can't fly against the wind. The same goes for any barns where larger animals like horses or alpaca are kept.  Sleep under a mosquito net If you're sleeping outside or in a room without screens, consider sleeping under a mosquito net.  The CDC recommends nets that follow the World Health Organization's criteria: white, rectangular, with 156 holes per square inch. Nets treated with permethrin, an insecticide, are most effective.  Wear long sleeves and pants In much of the country, it's still quite hot. But the CDC suggests covering up exposed skin on the arms and legs so infected mosquitoes can't bite it.  For extra coverage, spray permethrin on clothes, socks and shoes or buy pre-treated clothing. But use caution if you do it yourself, because permethrin shouldn't be applied directly on the skin.  Empty out stagnant water Any pools of standing water, whether in a bird bath, an old tire or a puddle, are prime breeding spots for mosquitoes. So be sure to empty them out -- particularly in areas your pets frequent.  The CDC also encourages scrubbing mosquito-friendly spots, including buckets and trash cans, at least once a week for good measure to make sure any mosquito eggs don't hatch.

"33","Measles outbreak that sickened 312 in Rockland County, New York, declared over","article","Officials in Rockland County, New York, declared Wednesday that its measles outbreak is over. The first measles case in Rockland County was identified October 1, 2018, with the last rash onset from measles identified August 13, 2019. Since the start of the outbreak, there were 312 confirmed cases of measles in Rockland County, according to the Rockland County Health Department. No new cases of the virus have been reported in the affected area since August 13. A measles outbreak is officially declared over 42 days after the last person infected by the disease develops a rash. More than 80% of the cases were in people age 19 and younger, Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, the Rockland County health commissioner, said at a news conference Wednesday. The county saw acute complications with multiple hospitalizations, including care for pneumonia and preterm births. ""Since October, nearly 30,000 measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations have been administered in Rockland County, which represents three times more than our annual baseline,"" Ruppert said. Along with the New York State Health Department and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, county health officials actively monitored 1,195 people who had or were exposed to measles. People with measles or who were exposed were voluntarily quarantined. ""That number is staggering, and it shows just how hard we've worked over the last year,"" said Rockland County Executive Ed Day. As summer camp season approached, it was important to the county that children be able to attend, Ruppert said. Health officials reviewed 18,791 immunization records of both staff and campers, so all camps in Rockland County received their permits and opened on time. Two MMR vaccines were required for campers and camp staff. ""I want to sincerely thank our community partners, including our local hospitals, urgent care facilities, health centers and primary care providers,"" Ruppert said. ""This was a true team effort."" Challenges to overcoming the outbreak  Reasons for the outbreak include people who refuse to vaccinate, anti-vaxxers and, largely, parents who ""create their own immunization schedules by delaying vaccinations"" -- all of which leave children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable disease, according to Ruppert. The outbreaks in Rockland County were largely among children in the Orthodox Jewish communities whose parents refused to vaccinate them. Living in clusters, which is common in the Orthodox Jewish community in New York, helps encourage measles to spread. Of the confirmed and reported measles cases as of August 26, 91% of the people infected had either not received the MMR vaccine or had no record of receiving one. Two doses of MMR are 97% effective against measles, according to the CDC. The state was having trouble communicating effectively with its Orthodox Jewish community about the dangers of the measles outbreak. The New York State Health Department spent tens of thousands of dollars creating and distributing measles information sheets in Yiddish to hang on the doors of more than 45,000 homes in those communities. But the Yiddish was mangled. The effort to present important measles information to this community in different ways, such as through WhatsApp and news phone lines, came six months after the outbreak. It wasn't until June that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation that removed nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements. Another challenge to the measles crisis was anti-vaxxers who specifically targeted the Orthodox Jewish community, spreading claims that vaccines caused conditions such as autism and sudden infant death syndrome. ""Vaccines have been thoroughly tested and are safe, effective and lifesaving,"" Ruppert said. ""To prevent possible future outbreaks, it's essential that all children who will receive vaccinations receive them on time."" Rockland County health officials urged that in addition to vaccination, people should heed the CDC's plan for travel to ensure protection against measles, which means knowing which countries are having measles outbreaks and the symptoms to watch for. ""Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on this planet,"" Day said. ""That has driven every decision during this outbreak, and despite setbacks, this outbreak has shown what we can accomplish with local, state and even federal levels of government when we work together.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/health/measles-outbreak-over-rockland-county-ny/index.html","2019-09-25T20:51:29Z","2019-09-25T20:55:10Z","2019-09-25T20:55:10Z","cnn","By Kristen Rogers, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190129095541-01-measles-vaccine-file-story-body.jpg"
"34","Second death from Eastern equine encephalitis reported in Connecticut","article","A second person in Connecticut has died due to Eastern equine encephalitis, state leaders said Tuesday, bringing the total of EEE deaths in the United States so far this year to nine. Connecticut reported its first death last week. Both individuals who died were older adults, according to the state's Department of Public Health. EEE is a rare virus that causes brain infections. There are typically only 5 to 10 human cases reported in the United States each year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 30% of all cases result in death. This year there has been an unusual uptick in the number of reported cases and deaths. In addition to the two Connecticut deaths, three people have died in Massachusetts, three in Michigan and one person has died in Rhode Island. There have been 27 human cases of EEE in six states in 2019, according to CNN's count. There have been 10 cases in Massachusetts, including three deaths; three cases in Rhode Island, including one death; eight cases in Michigan, including three deaths; two cases in Connecticut, both of them fatal; and three cases in New Jersey and one case in North Carolina. Connecticut Department of Public Health Commissioner Renée Coleman Mitchell said that she received a letter from the family of the person who died. In it, they strongly encouraged the state to warn people to take appropriate steps to protect themselves from the mosquitoes that transmit the virus.  ""Use repellant, cover bare skin and [decrease] the amount of time outside starting from an hour before dusk, from dusk to dawn,"" Coleman Mitchell said. There is a vaccine for EEE for horses, but not for humans. There have been five confirmed cases among horses in Connecticut this year. Connecticut Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz attributed the spread of the virus to climate change, citing the number of infections in nearby states and the number of cases that have happened so late in the year. ""We haven't seen anything like this since 1996,"" said Dr. Matthew Carter, Connecticut's state epidemiologist. In 1996, there were a number of infections that led the state to do more ground and aerial spraying for mosquitoes.

"35","Instagram will block content that promotes weight-loss products or cosmetic procedures to anyone under 18","article","Instagram announced a new policy that will block, and sometimes remove, content promoting weight-loss or cosmetic procedures to younger teens.  Users known to be under 18 will now be blocked from seeing posts promoting the use of certain weight-loss products or cosmetic procedures and those that have an incentive to buy or includes a price.  Content that makes a miraculous claim about certain diet or weight loss products, and is linked to a discount code or other offer, will no longer be allowed and will be removed from the platform. The changes come as the platform grapples with the impact of influencers promoting diet teas, supplements and certain cosmetic surgery.  ""We want Instagram to be a positive place for everyone that uses it and this policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel as a result of social media,"" Instagram's public policy manager Emma Collins said in a statement. While the change is being led on Instagram, the policy will also be in place on Facebook.  Over the coming weeks, Instagram will roll out a feature to allow users to report a post within the app if they believe it violates this policy. The post will then be reviewed and actioned appropriately by the app's team of content reviewers. The new policy change is a long time coming. Actress Jameela Jamil said she has been working with Instagram all year toward this change.  ""This is an extraordinary win that is going to make a big difference,"" the actress wrote on Instagram. ""Influencers have to be more responsible."" Jamil has been a loud advocate for these regulations for years. In 2018, she started the ""I Weigh"" campaign on Instagram, which promotes body positivity. She has publicly criticized celebrities like the Kardashian/Jenner family and Cardi B for promoting detox teas. This isn't the first time Instagram has attempted to control the content on their platforms. Earlier this year, the company said it would start blocking hashtags that surface vaccine misinformation, but two months after that announcement, misinformation was still rampant on the platform. A May CNN Business report revealed that, though Instagram had announced it was blocking hashtags like #VaccinescauseAIDS, the hashtag #VaccinesKill was still up on the app and appeared as a top result in a search for ""vaccines"" after anti-vax accounts.  Shortly after, the platform cracked down on blocking more hashtags. While the hashtags are no longer on the app, top results in a search for ""vaccines"" today are still all anti-vax accounts.  This year, Instagram also rolled out a set of tools to help manage time on the app more effectively and has been testing the removal of likes, which the company said is ""designed to help people focus on what they share rather than how many likes something gets.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/19/business/instagram-posts-cosmetic-surgery-diet-products-trnd/index.html","2019-09-19T15:38:49Z","2019-09-20T12:29:14Z","2019-09-20T12:29:14Z","cnn","By Gabrielle Sorto, CNN","business","BUSINESS","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190516142502-instagram-app-2-story-body.jpg"
"36","Polio makes a comeback in the Philippines 19 years after the country was declared free of the disease","article","The Philippines has reported its first case of polio since it was declared free of the childhood disease 19 years ago, dealing a blow to the campaign to eradicate it.  The country's department of health said the disease was ""re-emerging,"" with a case confirmed in a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur, on the southern island of Mindanao, and a suspected case awaiting confirmation.   The World Health Organization said it was ""very concerned"" at the re-emergence of the disease in the country; UNICEF described it as ""deeply disconcerting."" A global campaign to eradicate polio was launched in 1998 and cases due to the wild poliovirus have decreased by more than 99% since then, from an estimated 350,000 cases to 33 reported cases in 2018, according to WHO. However, the disease is still present in Pakistan and Afghanistan and the emergence of new, vaccine-derived strains of polio have complicated efforts to rid the world of the disease.  The last known case of wild poliovirus in the Philippines was in 1993. The country was declared wild polio-free in 2000 along with the rest of WHO's Western Pacific Region. The Philippines case was unexpected and the country was not on a list of at-risk countries compiled by the Polio Global Eradication Initiative.  Vaccination drive In addition to the confirmed and suspected cases, the polio virus was detected in samples taken from sewage in the capital, Manila, and in waterways in Davao, Mindanao, the country's third-largest city, as part of the regular environmental surveillance, the department said. The samples were verified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Japan National Institute for Infectious Diseases. The government said it was preparing a rapid response to the outbreak in coordination with WHO and UNICEF, with a mass polio immunization campaign for all children under 5 starting in October. ""We strongly urge parents, health workers and local governments to fully participate in the synchronized polio vaccination,"" Philippines Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a statement.  ""It is the only way to stop the polio outbreak and to protect your child against this paralyzing disease."" Polio is an infectious disease which spreads rapidly. It can cause paralysis and, on rare occasions, can be fatal. There is no cure for polio -- it can only be prevented with multiple doses of polio vaccines, WHO said. ""Aside from immunization, we remind the public to practice good personal hygiene, wash their hands regularly, use toilets, drink safe water, and cook food thoroughly,"" Duque added. Trust in vaccines was undermined in the Philippines after the government was forced to suspend a dengue fever vaccination program in 2017. The drug was distributed to more than 800,000 students as part of a school-based government immunization program, but was halted after clinical trial data showed that it could have unintended consequences in non-infected patients. Wild vs vaccine-derived polio The 3-year-old girl was found to have a vaccine-derived strain of polio virus type 2, which WHO said was of particular concern because the wild strain of this virus was eradicated in 2015.  Vaccine-derived polio happens when live strains of poliovirus that are used in the oral poliovirus vaccine mutate, spread and, in rare cases, trigger an outbreak. Most of the time the virus dies off but it can sometimes spread in an area where there is low vaccination coverage. ""If a population is not sufficiently immunized, the weakened virus can continue to circulate. The longer it is allowed to survive, the more changes it undergoes. In rare instances, the virus can change to a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), a form that has regained the ability to cause paralysis,"" WHO said.  ""Poorly conducted immunization activities, when too few children have received the required three doses of polio vaccine, leave them susceptible to poliovirus, either from vaccine-derived or wild polioviruses. Full immunization protects them from both forms of the virus,"" it added. So far in 2019, there have been 80 cases of vaccine-derived polio, not including the Philippines case, and 78 cases of the wild virus around the world, according to the Polio Global Eradication Initiative.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/19/health/philippines-polio-outbreak-intl/index.html","2019-09-19T12:36:04Z","2019-09-19T15:46:00Z","2019-09-19T15:46:00Z","cnn","By Katie Hunt, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819104026-spc-vital-signs-polio-vaccines-b-00014526-story-body.jpg"
"37","How climate crisis is accelerating the global spread of deadly dengue fever","article","Explosive outbreaks of dengue fever have rapidly spread in countries across Asia, killing more than 1,000 people, infecting hundreds of thousands and straining hospitals packed with sick families. Images from Bangladesh show patients in teeming hospital wards, lying beneath mosquito nets under lurid electric strip lights. Mothers cool their children from the sticky summer heat with hand-held fans while others rest on hospital floors, holding drips, waiting for a free bed. This is the worst outbreak Bangladesh has ever seen. Five times as many people were infected in August than the whole of 2018, and so far this year 57 people have died.  It's a similar story across the region. Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam have all reported higher than normal cases of the disease and deaths compared to last year. And the Philippines has declared a national dengue epidemic -- 1,107 people have died there since the start of the year and more than 250,000 have been infected.  Dengue is a seasonal, mosquito-borne disease commonly found in hot, wet regions of the tropics and subtropics during the rainy months. Scientists say hotter, wetter weather brought on by climate change has created ideal conditions for female mosquitoes to lay their eggs. Not only are there more mosquitoes, but the rapid urbanization occurring in many Asian nations means that susceptible populations are living in closer contact with disease-carrying insects. Add to the mix inadequate or unprepared health services and the circulation of a virus, and you have the ingredients for an outbreak of epidemic proportions -- and one that is likely to spread. The 'break-bone' fever and climate crisis Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, the same insect responsible for spreading Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. It causes flu-like symptoms, including piercing headaches, muscle and joint pains, fever and rashes, though only 25% of those infected show symptoms. Extreme cases can bring bleeding, shock, organ failure, and potentially death. It's the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, increasing 30-fold in the past 50 years. While it was once found in only nine countries, today the disease is endemic in more than 100 -- putting more than half the world's population at risk, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  There have been numerous studies on the link between climate change and mosquito-borne diseases and experts say the climate crisis is playing a major role in dengue's spread.  Scientists have repeatedly warned that rising temperatures are triggering more extreme weather events, and a warmer, wetter world could put us at greater risk of vector-borne diseases -- those transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks or other organisms. One recent study suggested that 1 billion more people might be exposed to mosquito-borne disease by 2080 as temperatures continue to rise with the climate crisis. Dengue-carrying mosquitoes thrive in urban areas and lay their eggs in shallow pools of water, in household containers, buckets, even upturned bottle caps. But environmental changes can affect how quickly viruses replicate in mosquitoes and how long they live, increasing the risk to humans.  ""As the average temperature increases the survival of mosquitoes and the actual replication of the pathogen with mosquitoes becomes more efficient,"" said Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, Coordinator of Malaria, Other Vectorborne and Parasitic Diseases, at the WHO's Regional Office for the Western Pacific. ""So the mosquitoes only need to survive for shorter periods of time."" Erratic weather makes it harder to predict outbreaks Since the start of the year, more than 7 million people have been displaced worldwide as a result of disasters such as flooding, cyclones, and droughts -- a phenomenon described by the researchers at Internal Displacement as becoming the norm. ""Climate change is altering weather patterns across the globe. Seasonality is changing, we're having less predictable extreme events,"" said Dr. Rachel Lowe of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  Lowe said that these changing patterns can cause the dengue season to shift ""making it harder to know when and where an epidemic might occur.""  2019 is also an El Nino year, a weather phenomenon that heats up the atmosphere and changes circulation patterns around the globe -- and the usually rainy Southern Asia becomes abnormally dry and experiences droughts. Abeyasinghe said it is one thing to have an intensive monsoon season where it rains steadily for a few weeks, but quite another to have showers that ""are scattered over a number of months, creating multiple opportunities for mosquito breeding and prolongs the survival of mosquitoes as opposed to a short, monsoon season."" As the planet gets warmer, scientists say, mosquito-borne diseases will continue spreading farther north. A recent study found that rising global temperatures caused by the climate crisis could see the female aedes aegypti mosquito which carries dengue -- along with other diseases such as chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika -- migrate to areas where it was not endemic before, with Europe, the US, East Asia and parts of central America, East Africa and Canada seeing large increases in risk. Modern lifestyles are also to blame But climate is just one factor in dengue's spread. We travel around a lot more than 50 years ago and it's not just souvenirs that we bring back from trips abroad.  ""People are able to travel across the globe within a few hours and that certainly facilitates the spread of dengue and can allow the virus to establish in places where it wasn't before,"" Lowe said. Even global trade can contribute to allowing invasive mosquito species to establish in new places as the insects and their eggs can be transported in tires, shipping containers, and even hitch a ride on planes. Some airlines, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, spray commercial planes to kill any mosquitoes on board before passengers disembark. The WHO said the threat of a possible dengue outbreak now exists in Europe as local transmission was reported for the first time in France and Croatia in 2010 and imported cases were detected in three other European countries. In October 2012, an outbreak of dengue occurred in Madeira, Portugal, resulting in more than 2,000 cases in a country where the disease is not normally found. There is a growing chorus among experts saying it's time policy makers start to prepare for the consequences of climate change and its affect on the spread of infectious diseases. ""The stark reality is that longer hot seasons will enlarge the seasonal window for the potential spread of vector-borne diseases and favour larger outbreaks,"" Dr Giovanni Rezza, Director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Istituto Superiore di Sanitá in Rome, Italy, said in a statement. ""We must be prepared to deal with these tropical infections."" Rezza said lessons should be learned from outbreaks of West Nile virus in North America and chikungunya in the Caribbean and Italy to ""highlight the importance of assessing future vector-borne disease risks and preparing contingencies for future outbreaks."" Stopping the dengue menace With no reliable vaccine, the main form of disease prevention to date has been mosquito control -- through the large-scale spraying of insecticides. But dengue is becoming resistant to pesticides in several countries where it was once a successful tool in curbing the disease.  The four strains of the virus mean it is difficult to get on top of with effective treatments, however work is underway to eventually eradicate the disease.  The World Mosquito Program is a nonprofit initiative that uses a naturally occurring bacteria to reduce the ability of mosquitoes to transmit diseases such as dengue.  It's called Wolbachia and scientists at the program inject it into mosquito eggs to make them dengue-resistant and then release the eggs or the fully-grown mosquitoes into communities where dengue is prevalent.  ""In each country we are working on, we've got a growing body of evidence that this seems to be a practical and effective way of stopping dengue,"" said Peter Ryan, Director of Business Development for The World Mosquito Program.  In ongoing field trials in 10 countries around the world, the team has found that mosquitoes passed the Wolbachia bacteria on from generation to generation -- meaning those mosquitoes did not transmit dengue. The program has been a success in northern Queensland, Australia, where the first trials were held in 2011. ""We've seen almost complete elimination of dengue from areas in northern Queensland where we have now successfully implemented Wolbachia. That's 300,000 people living in areas that had suffered from the scourge of dengue almost every year from the 1980s onwards and we have seen a complete collapse now."" Trials in Vietnam and Indonesia are also delivering positive results.  ""The challenge is, how do we scale this quickly to make it an affordable intervention,"" Ryan said. Their aim is to lower the cost of the program to about $1 for every person it helps, so it can be rolled out in some of the world's poorest nations. Field trials are expected to end in about 18 months. Progress is being made on the climate front too. Lowe's team is looking at how countries with dengue can set up early warning systems to predict future abnormal climate conditions and help prepare for potential outbreaks.  ""We can no longer rely on seasonal averages or average conditions to decide when dengue is going to peak,"" Lowe said.  ""We need to be thinking about how each place is linked up with other endemic areas, we need to be thinking about the climate conditions and unexpected extreme climactic events, which can change the time intensity of outbreaks."" Until scientists find an affordable way to stop dengue from spreading, the WHO is focusing on educating people about the disease -- and preventing more deaths. ""What we are encouraging countries to do is focus on better management of patients,"" Abeyasinghe said. ""Because if you manage the patient and you prevent the deaths, what we basically do is we turn dengue into a sort of normal flu-like thing. Which comes and goes.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/18/health/dengue-asia-outbreak-climate-intl-hnk/index.html","2019-09-19T01:30:07Z","2019-09-19T01:30:07Z","2019-09-19T01:30:07Z","cnn","By Helen Regan, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190916163200-dengue-bangladesh-hospital-ward-nets-story-body.jpg"
"38","Explosion and fire break out at Russian lab known for housing deadly smallpox virus","article","An explosion has caused a fire at a Russian biological research facility that's one of only two centers in the world known for housing samples of the smallpox virus. The blast occurred Monday during repair work of a sanitary inspection room at the Russian State Centre for Research on Virology and Biotechnology, known as Vector, near the Russian city of Novosibirsk in Siberia, the center said in a statement.  One worker was injured in the incident and is being treated in intensive care for burns, Russia's TASS news agency reported.  In its statement, Vector said that no biohazard material was being stored in the room where the explosion took place. The city's mayor also insisted that the incident does not pose any biological or any other threat to the local population, according to TASS.  The fire broke out when a gas cylinder exploded on the fifth floor of the six-story laboratory building in the city of Koltsovo. The blast caused windows to smash but there was no structural damage to the building, TASS reported.  Founded in 1974, the Center for Virology and Biotechnology was once known for developing biological weapons research during the Cold War Soviet era. It is now one of the world's largest research centers developing vaccines and tools for diagnosing and treating infectious diseases.  The head of the Koltsovo science city, where Vector is located, told Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti that there was no biological threat. Scientists at the center are developing vaccines for swine flu, HIV, and Ebola. In February, scientists there wrapped up clinical trials of an Ebola vaccine, according to TASS.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the only other center in the world approved and known to have live samples of the deadly smallpox virus.  Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration announced its approval of the first drug to treat smallpox. The contagious disease was eradicated in 1980 thanks to vaccination efforts, but there are concerns that it could be used in a bioterror attack. Could viruses survive a blast? Dr. Joseph Kam, Honorary Clinical Associate Professor at the Stanley Ho Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases (CEID) told CNN that rules for storing viruses are very strict and highly dangerous diseases such as Ebola and smallpox would be stored in the highest ""Level 4"" laboratory.  Access to the samples would be limited, special containers are used and the storage mechanism is different from other laboratories, Kam said.  He added that while fire would be hot enough to destroy viruses, an explosion could risk spreading the virus and there would be a danger of infecting those in the room or contaminating the immediate area.  ""Viruses are fragile and more than 100 degrees or more will kill them,"" Kam said. He added that under certain circumstances, an explosion could spread the virus. ""Part of the wave of the force of the explosion would carry it away from the site when it was first stored,"" he said. That contamination zone could be 10 to a few hundred meters depending on the size of the blast and other factors such as wind speed and direction, and whether it was an airborne virus.  The incident comes just weeks after an explosion near the site of a suspected failed missile test in northern Russia that killed at least five nuclear specialists and caused radiation levels to spike. Conflicting official accounts regarding the incident heightened concerns of a potential cover-up.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/17/health/russia-lab-explosion-smallpox-intl-hnk/index.html","2019-09-17T09:27:50Z","2019-09-17T10:30:46Z","2019-09-17T10:30:46Z","cnn","By Helen Regan, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160408165251-smallpox-vaccination-story-body.jpg"
"39","How to combat the anti-vaxxer message","article","On a recent day in my pediatric practice, I met a bouncing toddler and her parents. They, like my wife and I, are both working professionals. We shared the struggles of modern parenting -- getting our kids to bed on time, then ready in the morning so we can get them to childcare or school and ourselves to work, and then starting it all over again the next day. After some Q&A and an exam, I began to review the child's vaccine schedule. She was behind. Her parents told me they had done this deliberately because they had concerns about vaccines.   I let them know that we in medicine have a lot of experience with vaccines and that they've saved countless lives -- that the schedule and number of vaccines at each visit were meant to keep their daughter healthy. I told them this year's measles outbreak -- the worst in over a quarter of a century -- was an example of what might happen if we continue to let kids go unvaccinated or under-vaccinated. They responded by saying they weren't anti-vaccine, but they didn't think they needed to move along on the schedule the medical community was recommending. Our time ran short and they left without a clear plan as to when they would catch their daughter up on her shots. The parents of that toddler aren't part of the ""antivax"" group waging a continuous war against progress and enlightenment. Rather, these were what the medical community calls Vaccine Hesitant Parents (VHPs): a middle ground of caring, pragmatic parents who don't reject vaccines outright, but worry about them. Some worry because of something they've heard from other parents or because they read an account of a vaccine-damaged child online. Some may be dizzy from one too many Google searches that land on confusing and contradictory figures on the value and safety of vaccines. Not against vaccines, but hesitant It's perhaps easier to be influenced by these fears than the thought of what could happen if kids aren't vaccinated: the neurological consequences of measles; paralysis and suffocation from polio; the damage to brain and limbs from meningococcal disease. The World Health Organization identifies Vaccine Hesitancy as a top 10 threat to global health, where it shares a place alongside climate change, Ebola, and antibiotic resistance, among others.  It's crucial for us as doctors to work harder to persuade VHPs that the recommended regimen of vaccines is what will keep their children safe. If we want to keep our children and communities healthy, we must help VHPs understand the importance of immunization. To do this, we have to get to them earlier and use the power of conversation and emotional argument, along with science. For physicians, the opportunity to influence VHPs starts in the exam room, hospital or health system we practice in. Traditionally, the vaccination conversation starts at an infant's first checkup, around two weeks of age. But many parents begin contemplating vaccines during pregnancy or immediately after childbirth. If health care providers were to broach the topic then, it would offer an earlier chance to influence parents with some new approaches. A 2017 study by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that pregnant women who were given access to online social network tools were more likely to choose vaccination and immunize their kids on time when compared to subjects who were not. In another study published in the journal Vaccine in 2018, postpartum mothers were engaged in ""motivational interviewing,"" during which the interviewer explores a patient's feelings, readiness and confidence in vaccinating. These mothers showed a greater intent to vaccinate their infant and a greater rate of vaccination than control subjects. Both approaches, a social network and motivational interviewing, are practical, scalable and cost-effective ideas worth spreading. Word-of-mouth: where anti-vaxxers excel We also need to expand our reach outside of the exam room to utilize word-of-mouth, both in real and online communities. This is an area where anti-vaxxers have had great success. While the medical community has taken a top-down approach using expertise and data as our tools, anti-vaxxers started at the grassroots level — communities, schools, and social media — to spread their messages horizontally to other parents, using stories and images of children they allege are vaccine-injured victims. Their stories aim right at the heart. As opposed to the medical community, which is committed to protecting patient privacy and staying true to science, anti-vaxxers have free rein to say and do what they want, including bending and breaking facts to fit their narrative.  Several years ago, two Minnesota mothers, who run a blog and a website, challenged doctors and health professionals to combine their clinical knowledge with their power as advocates -- and, like anti-vaxxers, the power of stories. Writing in a medical journal, they told us plainly,  ""We are not vaccine experts, providers, scientists, or public health professionals. We are just parents who care about immunization and the health of our communities, and feel passionate about combating anti-vaccine messages — and we know of many more parents like us who would like to help. It's time for providers and others in the medical and public health community to realize they have partners waiting in the wings. With stories and science, this is a partnership that can make a real difference.""  No doubt they're right. A template for such a campaign can be found in the fight to spread information about the health risks of tobacco. The images, words and messages that communicate the dangers of smoking have are visceral in nature, meant to trigger fear, horror, anger and even disgust at what smoking can do to the human body. Though ""negative"" in tone, these messages are backed by scientific truth. It's unclear to me whether doctors, public health and policy leaders have used this tactic yet, as we don't know the conversations that are had in exam rooms. But much of the credible information online -- what can be found on the Center for Disease Control's website, for instance -- doesn't hold up against the stories of a parent's testimonial about the dangers of vaccines. The power of sharing real-life horror stories We need to change direction and share the real-life horror stories of what can happen when we fail to vaccinate our children -- certainly on social media. In a 2015 study of vaccine messages on Pinterest, a majority of the pinned items related to vaccines were decidedly anti-vaccine. Pinterest and Twitter have recently taken steps to mitigate anti-vaccine messages on their networks, while Facebook has done the same by rolling out educational pop-up windows that appear on vaccine-related groups and pages, or in searches for vaccine-related content and hashtags.  Pounding the pavement and speaking eye to eye with VHPs may be one approach to spreading the correct facts. One potential forum is at school. Children in Utah County, Utah, ranked sixth nationally for the total number of entering kindergarteners that were under-vaccinated in the 2016-2017 school year.  This is where researchers looked at whether college undergraduates (not yet parents) could be swayed to rethink their views of vaccines and found that nearly 7 in 10 vaccine hesitant students who had a conversation with the victim of a disease changed their minds.  Every community has storytellers -- from religious leaders to family members and friends. And let's not forget kids. It's worth considering how they could change hearts and minds where they live. Recently, a 17-year old high schooler went to Congress and revealed how he became a rebel with a cause by defying his vaccine-hesitant mother and getting shots on his own.   ""It's with love and respect that I disagree with my mom,"" he said.   He also corroborated the importance of story in changing minds.  ""People resonate better with stories. A large portion of the anti-vaccine information that my mom has provided me is on an anecdotal level. She would reaffirm her position because she would say that 'she knows people' and 'heard stories,'"" he told the committee. The medical community's job is to arm them with the right mix of stories and science. Most analyses of different approaches to persuade vaccine-hesitant parents to immunize is still new, and don't point in any single conclusive direction. Still, what's amazing is the breadth of effort -- in medicine, social psychology, behavioral economics, marketing, law, and on -- to change the conversation.  One side relies on the same, tired, tactics while the other is trying to constantly learn and adapt. I feel pretty confident that in the long run, I'm on the right side and it won't be long before I'll be able to change the minds of that bouncing toddler's loving parents.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/14/opinions/vaccine-hesitancy-opinion-parikh/index.html","2019-09-14T14:54:31Z","2019-09-15T01:37:23Z","2019-09-15T01:37:23Z","cnn","Opinion by Rahul Parikh","opinions","OPINION","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190416171238-lead-sanjay-gupta-measles-live-jake-tapper-00011313-story-body.jpg"
"40","California governor signs bills limiting vaccine exemptions","article","California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed two bills that limit medical exemptions for vaccines of schoolchildren. Under SB 276, California's Department of Public Health would investigate medical exemptions from doctors who have granted five or more in a year. The bill was first introduced by Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan in February and was approved by the legislature last week. Newsom also signed SB 714, a companion bill, which includes changes proposed by him, such as ""allow(ing) a child who has a medical exemption issued before January 1, 2020, to be allowed to continue enrollment until the child enrolls in the next grade span."" Newsom's approval of the stricter regulations comes a week after health officials in New York City said a massive measles outbreak that spread across parts of Brooklyn since October has ended. The crisis reignited a nationwide conversation about vaccinations and the need to implement tighter vaccine laws. California is among a handful of states -- including New York -- that do not offer personal, philosophical or religious exemptions from school vaccination requirements.  California, which previously had notable levels of unvaccinated schoolchildren, has recently seen an overall decrease after the state outlawed non-medical exemptions. Under the new laws, the state will issue a standardized medical exemption certification form for doctors to complete and send to a child's school. The form would outline the details of the exemption and include information about the medical basis for the exemption. In addition to reviewing doctors who grant five or more exemptions in a year, the state would also investigate schools ""with an overall immunization rate of less than 95 percent."" Additionally, the legislation gives California the authority to revoke a medical exemption deemed ""inappropriate"" by a state physician or public health officer.  Pan praised the signing of the bills on Monday, saying in a statement that Newsom was ""once again making California a leader in safeguarding children and communities from diseases that threaten our public health."" The signing of the bills, which will take effect January 1, 2020, came as anti-vaccination activists protested the legislation on Monday in Sacramento, arguing the new laws are an overreach by the state on medical problems that cannot be completely prevented by vaccinations.

"41","Senators: It's 'immoral and irresponsible' not to vaccinate migrants in CBP custody","article","It's ""immoral and irresponsible"" not to vaccinate migrants in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection against flu, said a letter sent Friday from 13 US senators to US Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan and US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.  Three children who had been in US custody have died after contracting flu. The decision not to vaccinate is ""placing entire communities at risk of the flu and its associated complications,"" the letter said. The decision ""could make wider flu outbreaks more likely,"" and that could put government workers and the American public at risk, according to the letter, signed by 13 Democratic senators. CBP has not responded to a CNN email requesting comment. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all people older than the age of 6 months get a flu vaccine by the end of October. Typically, the flu season begins to intensify around then. Many US pharmacies already have the vaccine available.  The flu can be deadly. According to another letter -- sent to HHS in August by doctors at Harvard and Johns Hopkins --  the rate of death of children in custody is ""substantially higher than that in the general population."" That letter called for a congressional investigation. Conditions in the facilities have been ideal for the spread of disease. A Department of Homeland Security inspector general report in June found ""dangerous overcrowding"" and unsanitary conditions at some of the facilities. Other groups that have monitored the conditions have had similar reports. In June, the Trump administration went to federal court and argued that it should not be required to give migrant children soap, toothbrushes or showers. The judges disagreed. This latest letter points out that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services policy manual requires people get an influenza vaccine for immigration purposes. ""In general, due to the short-term nature of CBP holding and the complexities of operating vaccination programs, neither CBP nor its medical contractors administer vaccinations to those in our custody,"" according to a statement from CBP in August. Migrants are supposed to be in custody for 72 hours or less, but are often there longer, and children without parents get sent into the care of HHS. Evelyn Stauffer, a spokesperson for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a part of HHS, said in August flu vaccines are distributed when the children are in custody there. The senators' letter asks the department how it plans to keep the flu from spreading and asks if every individual is tested for the flu. It asks who is doing the screening, how many pediatricians are on staff and what protocols the department has in place to quarantine sick children. The senators said they want answers by September 20. The letter from the senators comes a month after members of the House sent to a letter to DHS and HHS expressing similar concerns. The members of the House asked for a response by August, but have not heard back from the department, according to Will Serio, communications director for Rep. Rosa DeLauro.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/health/senators-flu-vaccine-migrants-letter/index.html","2019-09-09T22:31:13Z","2019-09-09T22:31:13Z","2019-09-09T22:31:13Z","cnn","By Jen Christensen, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181227151416-felipe-alonzo-gomez-story-body.jpg"
"42","Can the world eradicate another disease?","article","Banishing an infectious disease from the face of the Earth is the holy grail of public health -- a scientific and humanitarian feat for the ages.  It's also fiendishly difficult. Smallpox, which once killed 2 million people a year and disfigured many more, is the only human disease to have been eradicated. It was a feat achieved in 1979 following painstaking and lengthy vaccination efforts. (Rinderpest, a disease that affects cattle and also led to food shortages in Africa, was eradicated in 2011.) The world has come close with polio, but the eradication campaign launched in 1998 is nearly two decades past its 2000 deadline, and while the wild polio virus is cornered in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the emergence of new, vaccine-derived strains of the disease have complicated efforts. With some lucky breaks, the disease could be gone by 2023. Still, the resurgence of measles, another disease once thought to be down and out, serves as a cautionary tale.  Likewise, deadlines for the complete eradication of guinea worm disease, a debilitating condition that causes ulcers and swelling until the worm emerges from the feet, have come and gone without success.  Despite this checkered history, many in the global health community have another deadly disease in their sights: Malaria, which kills 400,000 a year, the majority children younger than 5.   A landmark report by 41 of the world's leading malariologists, biomedical scientists, economists and health policymakers released on Sunday calls for a world free of malaria by 2050 and sets out in detail the case for and path to eradication.  It comes 50 years after a first attempt failed.  ""For too long, malaria eradication has been a distant dream, but now we have evidence that malaria can and should be eradicated by 2050,"" said Sir Richard Feachem, co-chair of The Lancet Commission on malaria eradication and director of the Global Health Group at the University of California, San Francisco. Complex enemy It's an ambitious goal. As a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of the female mosquito, malaria is a much more complicated to tackle than smallpox or polio viruses, both relatively simple organisms. The parasite goes through many different changes during its life cycles in both its human and insect hosts.   And unlike polio and smallpox, a vaccine looks less likely to play a key role in its plotted demise. While a malaria vaccine is undergoing a large trial in three African countries, Feachem said that the jury was still out on whether that would be widely useful and that the commission's report ""foresees malaria eradication without a vaccine.""  ""We, the public health community, have had high expectations of malaria vaccines for 40 years and spent a lot of money trying to develop them,"" he said. ""But the commission cautions against spending too much money on vaccine research where the vaccines people have in mind do not confer significant advantages over the vaccine we already have.""    Instead, the report says eradication will rely on new drugs, diagnostics and insecticides in the pipeline to overcome the growing problem of resistance to malaria drugs and the insecticides used to impregnate things like bednets.  ""There's this evolutionary arms race between the parasite and our ability to keep on top of its evolving biology."" Feachem said. ""At the moment we're staying ahead of the evolutionary arms race but there's no certainty we can do that decade after decade. It's an argument that impels us to have a sense of urgency about this."" New technologies like gene editing also offer the promise of genetically modified mosquitoes that fight the others but while the science is there, Feachem said applying it in a real-world setting is likely a decade away, given the regulatory and ethical concerns of releasing a genetically modified creature into the environment. There are also wild cards like monkey malaria to contend with. Malaysia has come close to eliminating human malaria, but has seen thousands of people infected with a species of monkey malaria parasite. Overcoming 'a sense of defeat' The world first tried to eradicate malaria soon after the World Health Organization was founded in 1948. The program that lasted from 1955 until 1969 rid several countries of the disease, but it was not implemented in sub-Saharan Africa, the region most affected. ""Falling short of eradication led to a sense of defeat, the neglect of malaria control efforts and abandonment of research into new tools and approaches,"" the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group on Malaria Eradication said in its summary of a three-year review released on August 23. ""Malaria came back with a vengeance, millions of deaths followed. It took decades for the world to be ready to fight back against malaria.""  Huge progress was made between 2000 and 2015, with a 62% reduction in malaria deaths, according to WHO, and a 41% reduction in the number of cases. However, progress has stalled and more recent data suggests that malaria is making a comeback, with 219 million cases in 2017, compared with 217 million in 2016. While WHO said it remains deeply committed to the disappearance of the malaria parasite, the review suggested it was premature to put a date on it, concluding that the disease would not be eradicated with the currently available drugs and tools -- even though eradication would save millions of lives and a return on investment of billions of dollars. ""Even with our most optimistic scenarios and projection, we face an unavoidable fact: using current tools, we will still have eleven million cases of malaria in Africa in 2050,"" the report said. ""In these circumstances, it is impossible to either set a target date for malaria eradication, formulate a reliable operational plan for malaria eradication or to give it a price tag. ""We must not set the world up for another failed malaria eradication effort that could derail attempt to achieve our vision."" Moonshot? While many of the challenges that existed when the first eradication program was abandoned are similar to those today, Feachem said that our ability to respond to those challenges was ""completely transformed.""  ""We're now poised at this moment where we can take a cool-headed look at the progress we've made, the tools that we have in our hands and what's in the pipeline,"" he said.  ""To achieve this common vision, we simply cannot continue with a business-as-usual approach."" In addition to new drugs and technological innovations, one thing that will help ""bend the curve"" is better management of eradication programs -- something that's been enabled by better quality and time-sensitive data. In countries like Sri Lanka and China, which hasn't had a case of malaria since 2016, it has allowed authorities to move away from a one-size-fits-all national approach and tailor interventions to specific areas.  Money, of course, also plays a role and the commission report estimates than an extra $2 billion spending on malaria will be needed per year globally to rid the world of the disease. Feachem dismisses critics that say now isn't the time to push for an eradication date and instead health authorities should get back on track to meeting existing goals like lowering Malaria cases and mortality by 90%  by 2030. ""The commitment needs a time line and without one the commitment isn't totally serious,"" he said.   ""If President Kennedy had said in 1961, we will walk on the moon as soon as we can work out how to do it, we would never have walked on the moon by 1969.  ""But ... he said we'll walk on the moon before the end of the decade and it's that combination of a commitment with a timeline that is so powerful.""

"43","Cervical cancer can be eliminated. We must do more to prevent this deadly disease","article","Only a few cancers can be eradicated around the world. Cervical cancer is one. We have the tools and technical expertise to eliminate cervical cancer in the United States, but we lack the leadership, drive and advocacy to make this happen. That must change. Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women. In 2018, more than 300,000 women died from cervical cancer, even though the disease is largely preventable. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) took the bold and important step of drafting a comprehensive strategy to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem.  Why could they call for the elimination of a deadly cancer? Because vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer, are readily available and effective. The HPV vaccine provides nearly 100% protection against infections with the two major strains of HPV that cause about 70% of cervical cancers, as well as several other types of throat, anal and other cancers.  To eliminate cervical cancer, the WHO proposes vaccinating 90% of girls under the age of 15 by the year 2030. The strategy involves implementing broader programs for cancer screening and treatment with the aim of eliminating cervical cancer as a public health issue. Some countries are already ahead of the WHO recommendations. Australia was an early adopter of the HPV vaccine. It became one of the first countries to launch a national and publicly funded HPV vaccination program in 2007 and later organized a detailed program for cervical cancer screening.  A group of scientists and cancer experts now predict that Australia will eliminate cervical cancer by 2028. Rwanda, which has achieved high HPV vaccination rates for girls, is another success story.  Sadly, the United States lags far behind these two countries. According to estimates from the American Cancer Society, more than 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 2019, and more than 4,000 women will die from it. There are two major reasons for the numbers of cervical cancer deaths among American women. First, as many as 8 million American women are not getting screening tests for cervical cancer, which are crucial for early detection and treatment. Secondly, more teenagers in our country should be vaccinated against HPV. The CDC recommends all boys and girls be vaccinated at the age of 11 or 12, but, only 16% of US adolescents completed HPV vaccinations before 13, and 35% completed it before turning 15, according to the Journal of Infectious Diseases. In Kentucky and Mississippi, only about half of adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 received the HPV vaccine. These numbers are only slightly better in states like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri.  What has gone wrong? For one, adolescents and their families living in many rural areas of the country lack easy access to HPV vaccine. Some erroneously link the vaccine to promiscuity since HPV is sexually transmitted, and vaccine coverage is low in states considered conservative or highly religious. A third and a key reason is an aggressive antivaccine misinformation campaign that specifically targets the HPV vaccine.  Antivaccine groups falsely claim that the HPV vaccine causes autoimmune diseases and other chronic conditions, infertility, or even that it can cause teenage depression or suicide. There is no scientific evidence for such assertions. These phony worries are not tolerated in Australia, Scotland, or any other place on Earth trying hard to get rid of cervical cancer. Yet they are widely made on antivaccine websites and pseudoscientific books available on Amazon. The United States can and should achieve the targets set by the WHO. Our public health and elected leaders need to articulate a clear goal of advancing towards eliminating cervical cancer in America by the year 2030. This is feasible, but it means improving teenage access to the HPV vaccine while standing up to an aggressive antivaccine lobby. There is no excuse for continuing to condemn a generation of girls and women to cervical cancer and cancer deaths. Eliminating cervical cancer can be done. We owe it to our children to do it.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/07/opinions/cervical-cancer-can-be-eliminated-in-the-us/index.html","2019-09-08T00:25:58Z","2019-09-08T00:44:28Z","2019-09-08T00:44:28Z","cnn","Opinion by Arthur L.

"44","Vets fear anti-vax pet owners are putting their animals' health at risk","article","More pet owners are failing to vaccinate their animals, new figures show, and a UK animal charity is describing the growing problem as a ""ticking time bomb"" for pets.  Millions of animals are being left unprotected and vulnerable to potentially fatal diseases such as cat flu, rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease and parvovirus, according to the charity PDSA, with vets fearing that the anti-vax phenomenon is spreading to animals.  The number of domestic animals protected has seen a dramatic decline in recent years, according to the 2019 PDSA Animal Wellbeing (PAW) Report. The survey of 5,036 dog, cat and rabbit owners in Britain found that only two thirds (66%) of pets received their primary vaccinations when young, compared with 84% in 2016.  Furthermore, the report also revealed that about a third of pets (32%) are not getting their regular boosters, which ensure longer-term protection.  The 18 percentage point decrease over just three years could mean more than 7 million pets are now vulnerable to infection, according to the charity.  Creep of anti-vax sentiment into animal care The worrying fall coincides with the growth in the anti-vaxxer movement, with some parents expressing skepticism about the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines. Such resistance has been described as ""vaccine hesitancy"" and was listed by the  World Health Organization in its list of Top 10 Threats to Global Health in 2019.  Daniella Dos Santos, the British Veterinary Association's junior vice president, said the findings came as no surprise: ""Vets are deeply concerned about the creep of anti-vax sentiments into animal care. Our member survey found that 98% of vets have been questioned by clients about the need for vaccination.""  ""We always welcome questions from clients but we're worried that these conversations are being heavily influenced by what pet owners are seeing online from unreliable sources. Vaccination is vital in protecting pets from preventable and potentially fatal diseases that can be devastating for families."" Sean Wensley, a PDSA senior vet, called the decline in pet vaccinations ""extremely worrying."" ""Vaccinations have helped to protect millions of pets from serious diseases such as parvovirus, cat flu and Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease,"" he said. ""If people don't vaccinate, we risk seeing a rise in extremely unpleasant, preventable, diseases that can cause considerable animal suffering and death."" Pet owners gave a variety of reasons for failing to ensure their animals receive the right injections.  Of those who did not vaccinate, 17% deemed it ""too expensive,"" while the same proportion argued that their pet did not come into contact with other animals. A slightly lower proportion (16%) said they felt it was ""unnecessary,"" while 13% said that their ""pet found going to the vet very stressful."" Alice Jackson's pet kitten Mr. Meowgi recently died from Feline Leukemia virus (FeLV), a loss she described as ""incredibly distressing,"" for both herself and her son.  ""He was an indoor cat and never usually went outside, but one day he escaped and went missing, even though we're always careful not to let him get out,"" she said. ""If I'd have known a vaccination course would have saved his life I would have had this sorted immediately. Seeing him deteriorate so quickly was so traumatic. My son is autistic and had developed a close bond with him, and having to say goodbye to him has broken all of our hearts.""

"45","Facebook debuts vaccine pop-up windows to stop the spread of misinformation","article","A new feature is rolling out on Facebook and Instagram to combat the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation. Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced on Wednesday that educational pop-up windows will appear on the social media platforms when a user searches for vaccine-related content, visits vaccine-related Facebook groups and pages, or taps a vaccine-related hashtag on Instagram. If the user is based in the United States, the pop-up window will connect the user to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for credible information on vaccines. If the user is outside of the United States, it will connect them to the World Health Organization. The CDC praised Facebook's latest move to stop misinformation from circulating on its platform. ""We know that parents often turn to social media to access health information and connect with other parents, and it can be difficult to determine what is accurate and who the credible sources of information are,"" CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said in an email on Wednesday. Combating ""vaccine myths and misinformation is a shared responsibility and we applaud these efforts,"" she said in part. This launch comes at the same time a measles outbreak has hit the United States, reaching more than 1,200 confirmed cases across 31 states since the beginning of the year. Outbreaks have also spread around the world, resulting in four European countries losing their measles-free status. Public health experts have pointed to anti-vaccination content online as playing a major role in fewer people getting vaccinated against certain diseases, resulting in outbreaks of measles and other illnesses. ""The World Health Organization and Facebook have been in discussions for several months to ensure people will be able to access authoritative information on vaccines and reduce the spread of inaccuracies,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a written statement on Wednesday. ""Vaccine misinformation is a major threat to global health that could reverse decades of progress made in tackling preventable diseases. Many debilitating and deadly diseases can be effectively prevented by vaccines,"" he said. ""Major digital organizations have a responsibility to their users -- to ensure that they can access facts about vaccines and health. It would be great to see social and search platforms come together to leverage their combined reach."" Just last week, the social media platform Pinterest announced that searches for ""measles,"" ""vaccine safety"" and other vaccine-related content would only return results from public health organizations. The company said the new search experience is available now in English on its website and mobile apps. Earlier this year, Amazon removed anti-vaccine documentaries from its Amazon Prime Video streaming service and YouTube pulled ads from appearing on videos that promote anti-vaccine content. Facebook previously lowered the ranking of groups and pages that spread misinformation about vaccines in its News Feed and Search options. Now the educational pop-up windows are another step in efforts to tackle the spread of misinformation. ""We want people to get accurate information, particularly about health,"" Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an interview in June. ""When things are hate or things are violence, we take them down. But when things are false, we dramatically decrease it and we show the other side of the story, and that's because the debate has to happen,"" she said. ""The way you can say something is false is you have to be able to say, 'Here's the true side of the story,' and we want that debate to happen -- so that people do get educated and understand that the science is settled.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/health/facebook-vaccine-education-bn/index.html","2019-09-04T15:01:17Z","2019-09-04T15:01:17Z","2019-09-04T15:01:17Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181016140859-flu-vaccine-story-body.jpg"
"46","The US eliminated measles in 2000. The current outbreak could change that","article","There's a ""reasonable chance"" the United States will lose its measles elimination status in October because of ongoing measles outbreaks in New York, according to Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. ""It certainly is incredibly frustrating and upsetting to the public health community that we may lose measles elimination status, because we do have a safe and effective vaccine,"" Messonnier said. When the World Health Organization declared in 2000 that the United States had eliminated measles, it was hailed as one of the biggest public health achievements in the nation's history. Losing that elimination status would be a black eye to the United States, public health experts said. ""We're embarrassed. We're chagrined,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the CDC on vaccine issues. WHO removes a country's elimination status when measles has been spreading continuously for one year. A measles outbreak in New York City started on September 30, 2018, and has caused more than 600 confirmed cases of measles. An outbreak in nearby Rockland County, New York, started the next day and has caused more than 300 cases. Those two outbreaks have largely been among children in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community whose parents have refused to vaccinate them. Twenty-nine other states have had measles outbreaks in the past 12 months, but those were much more short-lived than the ones in New York. CDC plans on releasing a detailed statement next week about the country's measles elimination status, according to Messonnier. Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said he thinks it's highly unlikely the measles outbreaks will be over before September 30. This week, the CDC announced 12 new cases of measles, most of them in New York. Schaffner said things will likely only get worse when children there go back to school early next month and begin congregating again in close quarters. Losing measles elimination status ""is a big deal in terms of reputation and prestige,"" said Dr. Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University. It also could have ramifications worldwide. Spiegel, a former senior official at the UN Agency for Refugees, said it could undermine longstanding US efforts to convince other countries to double down on vaccinating their citizens. ""If we are not able to take care of our own backyard, how can we tell others what to do?"" he said. When vaccine rates plummet, death and disability from measles increases. In 2017, there were 110,000 measles deaths globally, mostly among children under age 5, according to WHO.  Measles can also cause blindness and encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. Polio mistaken for a shirt   It was just three years ago that WHO declared the Americas to be free of measles. ""This is a historic day for our region and indeed the world,"" Dr. Carissa Etienne, then director of the Pan American Health Organization, a part WHO, said at the time. No one foresaw what would follow. Venezuela lost its measles elimination status in 2018, followed by Brazil earlier this year. For those countries, economics and political upheaval were at play. For the United States, it was Facebook and Twitter. As anti-vaccine sentiment has grown on social media -- some of it propelled by Russian bots and trolls -- more and more parents have opted to not immunize their children. These parents tend to live in clusters, such as the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in New York, which helps encourage measles to spread. While social media is a part of parents' everyday lives, the ravages of vaccine-preventable diseases are in the distant past. Schaffner said when he's spoken to parent groups, there's been considerable ignorance about even basic facts about infectious diseases. ""This is a true story. At one of these meetings I was talking about polio, and a mother asked me -- and this is a complete quote -- 'Why are you suddenly talking about shirts?' It took me a minute, but I realized she thought I was talking about polo shirts,"" Schaffner said. ""This was a college educated woman out in the business world and she hadn't come across the concept of polio. She may be a bit of an outlier -- but maybe not. I think she actually illuminates the problem."" 'Not our finest hour'   Looking back, public health experts see lost opportunities for combating that problem. While anti-vaxers were busy spreading their false propaganda, ""the good guys,"" as Schaffner calls them, failed to effectively communicate how dangerous diseases like measles can be. Those ""good guys,"" he said, include groups such as the CDC as well as doctors' groups. ""I think this was not our finest hour,"" Schaffner said. Dr. William Moss, an infectious disease pediatrician at Johns Hopkins, agrees. While anti-vaxers circulated videos on social media of mothers citing false claims about vaccines, public health groups failed to tell the stories of the ravages of diseases like measles. ""We didn't do enough to get a mother on camera to say 'my child died of measles' or had brain damage from measles. I think we could have done better with our public health messaging,"" said Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins. Messonnier, the CDC doctor, said she and her colleagues have learned a lot of lessons about social media. ""I do think it caught us all a little flat-footed -- how quickly the myths and misinformation spread,"" she said. ""Of course, I wish I had 20/20 hindsight and had figured this out a couple of years ago.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/health/us-measles-elimination-status-in-jeopardy/index.html","2019-08-28T11:12:52Z","2019-09-03T18:29:10Z","2019-09-03T18:29:10Z","cnn","By Elizabeth Cohen, CNN Senior Medical Correspondent","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190129095541-01-measles-vaccine-file-story-body.jpg"
"47","New York City measles outbreak has ended, health officials say","article","A massive measles outbreak that spread across parts of Brooklyn since October has ended, New York City health officials announced Tuesday. This marks the end of the largest measles outbreak New York City has seen in nearly three decades. Measles outbreaks are typically declared over when two incubation periods for measles -- which is about 42 days -- have passed since the last day a person with measles is infectious in an affected area. That time period has now passed for the people most recently infected with measles and reported to the New York City Health Department, according to the city. No new cases have been reported since mid-July, the city's health department said, but officials will continue keeping track and may add cases retrospectively as they are identified. The city also could see future measles cases emerge that are not associated with this outbreak. ""Ending the measles outbreak required extensive collaboration with community organizations and Jewish leaders. They helped encourage vaccinations and achieve record immunization levels in parts of Brooklyn,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a written statement on Tuesday. ""As we head back to school this week, we just remain vigilant. To keep our children and communities safe, I urge all New Yorkers to get vaccinated. It's the best defense we have,"" de Blasio said. Fighting the outbreak To battle the outbreak, the city spent more than $6 million and dedicated more than 500 staff to work on response efforts, which included disseminating messages for people to get vaccinated and hosting community events. Since the outbreak began in October, more than 5,000 measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations have been administered, according to the city. In April, the city declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency, and that unvaccinated people living in select ZIP codes were required to receive the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to curtail the outbreak and protect others. ""Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the face of the earth,"" New York City health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said in the new statement. ""There may no longer be local transmission of measles in New York City, but the threat remains given other outbreaks in the U.S. and around the world. Our best defense against renewed transmission is having a well immunized city,"" Barbot said. ""Vaccination coverage has increased significantly since the emergency order, which has been supported by community-led efforts. We are grateful to the New Yorkers who shared the truth about vaccines and protected the health of their friends and neighbors through this outbreak."" The nation's measles elimination status still at risk  Even though the outbreak has been declared over in New York City, the measles virus is still circulating in other regions of New York and the United States -- which means there's still a chance that the United States could lose its measles elimination status in October because of ongoing measles outbreaks in New York state. The World Health Organization removes a county's elimination status when measles has been spreading continuously for one year. The measles outbreak in New York City started on September 30, 2018, and has caused more than 600 confirmed cases of measles. Another outbreak in nearby Rockland County, New York, started the next day and has caused more than 300 cases -- and that outbreak is still ongoing. Those two outbreaks have largely been among children in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community whose parents have refused to vaccinate them. As of last week, about 30 other states have had measles cases in the past 12 months, but those were much shorter-lived than the ones in New York. ""It certainly is incredibly frustrating and upsetting to the public health community that we may lose measles elimination status, because we do have a safe and effective vaccine,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said last week.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/03/health/new-york-city-measles-outbreak-over-bn/index.html","2019-09-03T17:51:11Z","2019-09-03T17:57:21Z","2019-09-03T17:57:21Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190129095541-01-measles-vaccine-file-story-body.jpg"
"48","Hundreds of detained migrants have had mumps, CDC reports","article","A total of 898 detained adult migrants had mumps in the last year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday. Some cases were confirmed by testing, others were considered ""probable"" based on symptoms, the public health agency stated.  The cases were reported at 57 facilities in 19 states. An additional 33 staff members were also diagnosed with the contagious disease caused by a virus spread through saliva and mucus, the CDC said. The numbers were reported from last September to last week. Of the 315 facilities in use, 18 percent had a single case or outbreak of mumps, the CDC said, and 44% of the cases were reported in Texas. Private companies operated 34 of the affected facilities, 19 were county jails, and four were operated by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. All the usual places  Crowding and close contact fuel the spread of mumps. The usual settings for outbreaks are places where people congregate -- schools, college dorms, Army barracks and athletic events. In such places, saliva is transferred person to person due to coughing, sneezing, kissing and the sharing utensils, lipstick or cigarettes. Since 2015, about 150 mumps outbreaks and 16,000 cases have been reported in the United States.   This is the first time the CDC has reported on mumps outbreaks in detention facilities.  Most patients (84%) became exposed to the mumps while in custody, the agency found. The majority (94%) were men at an average age of 25 years old.  Symptoms and prevention Mumps typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite lasting a few days. Most people will then see swollen glands, causing puffy cheeks and jaw.  The incubation period for mumps ranges from 12 days to 25; symptoms last at least two and usually more than 10 days. Mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.  Thirteen patients were hospitalized, while 15% of the infected men developed testicular inflammation, a mumps' complication that infrequently causes sterility, the CDC found.   Different detention facilities have different mumps vaccination programs. Each should follow local and state health department recommendations -- including reporting cases to state health departments, the CDC stated. Detainees and staff who are at increased risk for mumps should be offered the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine during outbreaks, noted the CDC.   Developed in the 1970s, the MMR vaccine is usually given to young children in two shots spread out over a few years. When two doses are given, it is 88% effective, less so in people who receive just one shot.  ""As of August 22, 2019, mumps outbreaks are ongoing in 15 facilities in seven states, and new introductions into detention facilities through detainees who are transferred or exposed before being taken into custody continue to occur,"" the CDC concluded.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/30/health/mumps-cases-detained-migrants-cdc-trnd/index.html","2019-08-30T19:08:28Z","2019-08-30T19:08:28Z","2019-08-30T19:08:28Z","cnn","By Susan Scutti, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190713085917-migrant-kids-lying-down-story-body.jpg"
"49","Four European countries lose measles-free status as anti-vax movement drives outbreaks","article","Four European countries have lost their measles-free status as the region suffers a significant setback in eliminating the disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). With measles cases across Europe on course to double this year, the disease has made a comeback in Albania, Czech Republic, Greece and the United Kingdom, where it had previously been eradicated, a WHO report said.  Recent outbreaks of the potentially fatal viral disease in various countries have been blamed on the growth of the anti-vaccination movement, which has spread via social media and discourages parents from immunizing their children against measles and other diseases. Right-wing populist politicians including Italy's Matteo Salvini, who has promoted a bill removing mandatory vaccination for children, have also been influential in pulling the public away from scientific orthodoxy.  At the end of 2018, 33 of 53 countries in the European region retained their measles elimination status. Two -- Austria and Switzerland -- achieved measles-free status, according to the WHO, which means they have not had any new cases of the disease for 36 months. Two countries have interrupted measles transmission, having had no new cases for 12-35 months. Twelve countries remain endemic for measles, and the four countries mentioned previously have re-entered measles transmission. ""Re-establishment of measles transmission is concerning,""  said Dr Günter Pfaff, Chair of the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC).  ""If high immunization coverage is not achieved and sustained in every community, both children and adults will suffer unnecessarily and some will tragically die."" There have been approximately 90,000 cases of measles reported in the first half of 2019, continuing a surge in the number of cases that began in 2018, when 84,462 cases were reported over the course of the year. The WHO has declared a Grade 2 emergency and intensified its efforts against measles, according to a statement. ""Great efforts to control this highly contagious disease have brought us a long way towards regional elimination,"" said Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe. ""This is the time and opportunity to address any underlying health system, social determinants and societal challenges that may have allowed this deadly virus to persist in this region."" Online misinformation a key culprit Social media is proving to be a key battleground for health information. Professor Martin Marshall, vice-chair of Britain's Royal College of GPs, said the findings were ""disheartening"" at a time when Europe had been making good press in eliminating an entirely preventable disease. He drew a link between declining vaccination rates and the spread of ""anti-vaxer propaganda"" on social media. ""It is clear that we are still suffering from entirely debunked claims around MMR (the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) that were perpetuated in the nineties -- and are now resurgent on social media and other online platforms,"" said Marshall in a statement. However some social media platforms are taking action. From August 28, Pinterest searches for vaccine-related terms will now only show results from institutions such as the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the WHO-established Vaccine Safety Net, in an attempt to stop the spread of anti-vax content. ""Misinformation about vaccines is as contagious and dangerous as the diseases it helps to spread,"" said the WHO in a statement. ""The World Health Organization welcomes Pinterest's leadership in protecting public health by only providing evidence-based information about vaccines to its users."" And in February, Facebook pledged to fight vaccine misinformation on its platforms. A global issue The issue has also reared its head in the US, which may soon lose its measles-free status due to outbreaks that have caused more than 900 cases of measles. Those outbreaks have largely been among children in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community whose parents have refused to vaccinate them. When the WHO declared in 2000 that the United States had eliminated measles, it was hailed as one of the biggest public health achievements in the nation's history.  Now there is a ""reasonable chance"" the country could lose its status in October, according to Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Health professionals are looking into a number of solutions, including making vaccinations mandatory and imposing fines on parents who refuse. One example is Germany, where the government has backed a bill that would see parents fined up to €2,500 ($2,800) if they fail to vaccinate their children before entering school or kindergarten. Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told CNN that health authorities should be in emergency mode due to the seriousness of the situation. ""Ninety-thousand cases in the first half of the year is a massive amount of measles,"" she said, adding that nations should be ramping up routine vaccination programs to proactively identify under-vaccinated groups. Larson also recommends that health authorities get involved in social media to spread positive messages about vaccines. ""That's where people are,"" said Larson, who believes that efforts need to be made to crowd out anti-vax information. ""We've created a world that's absolutely dependent on vaccination,"" she added. ""This is a really big deal.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/29/health/europe-measles-outbreaks-scli-intl/index.html","2019-08-29T15:13:05Z","2019-08-29T15:13:05Z","2019-08-29T15:13:05Z","cnn","By Jack Guy, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502192608-measles-story-body.jpg"
"50","Doctor: Refusing vaccines for migrants is cruelly stupid","article","Last flu season several migrant children in US custody died of influenza, many children and adults became seriously ill with influenza, and we can expect the same this year, because the Trump administration's policies are putting migrants and us in the US at risk of a significant influenza outbreak. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) refuses to disclose how many migrants in their detention facilities have contagious diseases and will not vaccinate migrants.  Influenza killed 80,000 Americans last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention( CDC), most elderly but over a hundred young children as well. For many more, getting the flu meant hospitalization, lost work or school time and contracting other serious illnesses such as pneumonia because they were left more vulnerable to other infections by the flu. By July of this year, the World Health Organization reported influenza activity was increasing in Argentina, Cuba, French Guiana, and Uruguay and was high in Costa Rica and Panama.  The flu typically spreads north each year, starting in South America, Australia, and Southeast Asia in the early summer, then from South America up through Mexico and into the US by early September. Sometimes it travels north or west very quickly, usually via sick people traveling by airplane, arriving one or two cases at a time, even in summer. And it spreads relentlessly.  It's time now in the US to vaccinate against influenza. The season starts in September and lasts through March, usually. Vaccinating the asylum-seekers would protect them, many of whom are in ill health after a long detention and exhausted from the long journey. And, it would protect the staff at CBP facilities and their families, then in turn the schools and communities they touch.  Refusing to vaccinate a vulnerable population endangers these people, the Americans who hold them in detention, and all of our communities. It's a foolish and cruel policy, and the rationale CBP offered is disingenuous. There are plenty of doctors and nurses who would like to volunteer to help give flu shots, and the CDC could allocate vaccines to those at risk.  CBP released a statement earlier this month blaming ""complexities of operating a vaccination program,"" along with ""the short-term nature of CBP holding,"" for their failure to vaccinate the people they detain in close quarters, in cold rooms, with inadequate nutrition and medical care, and often for long durations.  The very practices CBP implements place people they detain at higher risk for influenza transmission. And, vaccination programs aren't ""complex."" They are handled every day by small local health departments, schools, businesses, churches -- registered nurses can manage these programs, and many physicians who practice in states with CBP facilities have volunteered (but been rejected by CBP) to help care for these asylum-seekers.  Influenza vaccines should be given each year to everyone from age 6 months and up. Protection from this year's vaccine is expected to be good, but it's not perfect. And, US vaccination rates are low -- according to the CDC, less than 40% of US adults get an influenza vaccine each year in the US.  I went to Laredo, Texas, in July this summer to care for migrants in a volunteer clinic and shelter hosted by the local Catholic Charities organization and organized by Drs. Claudia Mercado and Dona Kim Murphey. I cared for exhausted, thin, frightened people who told me they were held for days to weeks in ice-cold rooms and with scant food thrown at them, much of which they gave to their children. Many families were dropped off by CBP without one parent -- some told me why, but others just cried or sat silent. Then, the number of people CBP brought to the shelter each day dropped precipitously. From 100-200 per day down to 15, then eight, then none. The following week there were a few days of 100 people, then again, none. CBP practice had changed again. As Dr. Murphey pointed out to me, one of the reasons doctors are providing post-release care is because CBP refuses to allow doctors to help migrants actually in detention. The Trump administration is also now pushing to detain migrants indefinitely, bringing into question CBP's statement on short detentions. As a nation, we are stealing basic human rights from people who legally seek our help from the significant dangers they faced in their countries of origin. Our processes are cruel, but they are also foolish. We must, all of us, doctors and nurses, parents, and business owners, speak out and insist that influenza vaccine be given to migrants at the border, to protect them, and to protect all of us, for the health of our nation, and for the world.

"51","Pinterest searches about vaccines will surface content from public health organizations","article","Pinterest searches for ""measles"", ""vaccine safety"" and other vaccine-related content will only return results from public health organizations, the social media company announced Wednesday. Last year, Pinterest stopped showing search results related to vaccines in order to the prevent the spread of harmful health misinformation. Searching Pinterest now only shows results from institutions such as the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the WHO-established Vaccine Safety Net. ""We're taking this approach because we believe that showing vaccine misinformation alongside resources from public health experts isn't responsible,"" Ifeoma Ozoma, Pinterest's public policy and social impact manager said in a statement. ""As we continue to tackle health misinformation, we remove it and the accounts that spread it from our service."" No recommendations or comments will appear on Pins in these results and it won't show ads. The company said the new search experience is available now in English on its website and its mobile apps. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told CNN this week that social media changes could ""help us turn the tide"" on vaccine misinformation. Still, Messonnier said there's a ""reasonable chance"" the United States will lose its measles elimination status in October because of ongoing measles outbreaks in New York. Messonnier said she and her colleagues were surprised by the influence social media had on vaccines. ""I do think it caught us all a little flat-footed -- how quickly the myths and misinformation spread,"" she said. ""Of course, I wish I had 20/20 hindsight and had figured this out a couple of years ago."" In a statement, WHO said social media is how many people get their information and ""they will likely be major sources of information for the next generations of parents."" It noted that vaccine misinformation has spread on social media in many countries, ""including during critical vaccination campaigns like those for polio in Pakistan or yellow fever in South America.""

"52","CBP refuses to publicly reveal how many migrants are sick with contagious diseases","article","Despite outbreaks of flu, tuberculosis and chicken pox, US Customs and Border Protection refuses to tell the public how many migrants in detention facilities have contagious diseases. Doctors have long been concerned that these congested settings are breeding grounds for serious illnesses. ""They create facilities that encourage the spread of infectious agents,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine issues. A CBP senior health official told CNN his agency keeps track of infectious diseases among the hundreds of thousands of migrants who pass through CBP detention facilities but declined to release that data. This stands in stark contrast to how other entities handle disease statistics. State and county health departments across the United States track ongoing case counts for dozens of infectious diseases and make that information available online. Similarly, the United Nations posts disease statistics about refugees online. Public health experts sharply criticized CBP for what they called the agency's lack of transparency. ""What are they scared of?"" asked Dr. Paul Spiegel, a former senior official at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who is now the director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University. He said making such information available is crucial to public health. ""In health, we measure things, and the more people who know that information, the better,"" he said. ""Migrants are released into the community and quickly move to other places in the country."" The CBP official said his agency reports illnesses to state health departments. ""We do share this information. We're not hiding it,"" he said. However, CNN's review of the deaths of three children who had the flu and died while in CBP custody or shortly after raises questions about whether infectious disease data on migrants is consistently reported to state health officials. In addition, a review of state health department websites indicates that disease data on migrants is not available to the public, which would include researchers and physicians. Public health transparency  In the first seven months of 2019, more than 600,000 migrants were apprehended crossing the US southwest border. CBP policy, rooted in legal agreements, aims to move both children and adults out of its custody within 72 hours. Government reports show, however, that both children and adults have been held for considerably longer than 72 hours. ""We've seen everything from mumps, chicken pox, flu, and tuberculosis,"" a CBP spokesperson wrote in an email to CNN. The spokesperson and the agency's senior health official, both of whom spoke on the condition that their names not be used in this report, declined to provide a full list of infectious diseases observed in migrants, or the number of cases or deaths from those diseases. Spiegel, the former UN official, said that's unfortunate because when the United Nations released health surveillance data online, public health researchers could then analyze the data and offer important insights. ""We had people all over the world look at this data and write papers on it, and it was helpful,"" he said. ""The more data that's out there, the better."" Dr. Jonathan Winickoff, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, added that such transparency also helps doctors in the area aid migrants and the surrounding population. ""There's a reason why numbers are reported and made public, and that's so clinicians and public health responders in those locations can understand the nature of the risk and take appropriate actions and make sure the public is protected,"" Winickoff said. ""When the numbers are invisible, it's very hard to take protective action."" Doctors urge CBP to vaccinate children  One of the most important protective actions is to vaccinate migrants, Winickoff said. Earlier this month, Winickoff, Spiegel and three other physicians sent a letter to members of Congress expressing concern about infectious diseases at migrant detention centers. Detailing the deaths of three children in US custody who died after contracting the flu, the doctors urged that migrant children be vaccinated against the virus. According to a CBP statement, the agency doesn't vaccinate migrants ""due to the short-term nature of CBP holding and the complexities of operating vaccination programs."" Winickoff and Spiegel said that argument doesn't make sense to them. They said it's relatively quick and inexpensive to vaccinate even large groups of people. The doctors said vaccination helps protect migrants and the people around them as they move out of CBP facilities and into other government facilities or into the US community at large. Spiegel said the UN refugee agency, where he worked for 15 years, oversaw programs that vaccinated millions of refugees soon after they crossed international borders. ""If we can do it in places like Darfur and South Sudan, I imagine the US government can do it,"" he said. ""Frankly, it's not so hard and it's not so complicated."" Reporting migrant illnesses and deaths   The CBP senior health official said his agency shares health surveillance data with the four state health departments along the southwest border. ""We do share that information and record and coordinate through the established public health channels,"" he said. ""We do share this information."" When asked what diseases CBP reports to state health departments, the official said it depends on the laws of that particular state. ""Obviously every case of scabies doesn't need to be reported or raised,"" he said. In Arizona, however, outbreaks of scabies -- a skin infestation where mites burrow under the skin -- is required to be reported. Nationwide, pediatric flu deaths are required to be reported to state health authorities. But it appears the deaths of two out of the three migrant children who had the flu and died were not reported to state health departments. 8-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo died in December in New Mexico after contracting the flu. But according to the New Mexico Department of Health, there were two pediatric flu deaths in the 2018-2019 flu season -- one child was 16 and the other was 1 year old. 2-year-old Wilmer Josue Ramirez Vasquez died in May in El Paso after contracting the flu. The Texas Department of State Health Services reports no pediatric flu deaths in that region of the state during the 2018-2019 flu season.  16-year-old Carlos Hernandez Vasquez died in May in Hidalgo County, Texas after contracting the flu.  It's unclear if his death is included among the five pediatric flu deaths that occurred in that region of the state during the 2018-2019 flu season. Doctors said publicly reporting infectious diseases and deaths is crucial to protecting public health. ""It matters deeply to make sure that others are not infected,"" Spiegel said. ""The public needs to understand what's going on in these facilities.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/23/health/cbp-migrants-contagious-diseases/index.html","2019-08-23T11:20:29Z","2019-08-23T11:20:29Z","2019-08-23T11:20:29Z","cnn","By Elizabeth Cohen, John Bonifeld and Minali Nigam, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190713085917-migrant-kids-lying-down-story-body.jpg"
"53","How to end the Ebola crisis","article","This week, I was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the deadly Ebola virus has killed nearly 2,000 people, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern.  The WHO has been hard at work leading the world's response to this crisis. This is the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history, and requires a robust, unified international response that goes far beyond the medical treatment of the disease's victims. The United States has been the world's largest single-country donor to this crisis, with USAID contributing $136 million and other agencies providing extensive technical assistance since the outbreak began last year. We are working closely with the WHO and the international community, armed with the lessons learned and innovations developed during the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak. As administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and with support across the Trump administration, I deployed an elite disaster team to the DRC, comprising experts from USAID and the Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the heart of the challenge to contain and cure the disease is pervasive insecurity and community distrust. Numerous conflicts and acts of violence, particularly in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, hinder access to medical professionals and disrupt response operations. Some of the perpetrators are armed gangs vying for control of land and resources; some are extremists attempting to render areas ungovernable or to send political messages. But the insecurity runs still deeper. Decades of corrupt, authoritarian rule during which communities were denied any meaningful voice in their government have undermined the Congolese people's trust in institutions. People living in desperate poverty have watched kleptocrats enrich themselves by selling off natural resources and diverting funds away from those in greatest need.  This has fueled sweeping distrust of outsiders -- including, too often, heroic health care workers who are trying to manage the Ebola response. In order to enable the public health response to work effectively, the community distrust of domestic institutions and outside assistance must be addressed. To start, the United States urges all parties to more earnestly engage nongovernmental organizations already on the ground in Eastern DRC, many of whom are trusted community health care providers and must be integrated into the broader Ebola response. We also call for greater transparency from everyone involved in the response with respect to both data sharing and expenditures of funds, an effort that will increase buy-in from local communities and prospective donors. Additionally, we will continue to push for health workers to have all the tools they need to fight the disease. That includes deploying a robust vaccine strategy in at-risk areas of the DRC and in communities along the country's borders. We will also call on other bilateral donors to do their part. The United States and the United Kingdom have been generous in supporting the WHO's efforts. The World Bank has also come through with significant resources. Others need to step up, and step up fast. The elite team already on the ground has supported vaccination campaigns, helped to improve laboratory diagnostics and assisted with testing and contact tracing. We have also facilitated significant community engagement campaigns, which were key to ending the 2014 West Africa outbreak, including provisions for ""safe and dignified burial"" teams to minimize unsafe contact with remains that might still be infectious.  This week, the US Ambassador to the DRC Mike Hammer and I met with officials from the government of the DRC, urging immediate action to address the underlying issues impeding efforts to end the Ebola outbreak.  We welcome DRC President Felix Tshisekedi's efforts to forge a strong partnership with the United States government, while recognizing the need to undertake significant political and security reforms that will renew hope in the population for a more responsive relationship with the central government. President Tshisekedi's visits to the Ebola-affected region and recent steps by DRC's Ebola coordinator, Dr. Jean Jacques Muyembe, to improve coordination with the many stakeholders involved in the response are promising signs that the government of the DRC will continue to prioritize attention to the outbreak. We are far from containing this disease, but, as the recently appointed United Nations Emergency Ebola Response Coordinator David Gressly has said, despite all the challenges we face, nothing is insurmountable. I agree, but know that long, difficult months are ahead.

"54","Africa begins countdown to being polio free as Nigeria marks 3 years without disease","article","Africa has gone three years without a case of wild polio being detected, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, a significant milestone in the quest to eradicate the disease.  The continent's last case of polio caused by the wild virus was detected on 21 August 2016 in Nigeria. Africa is expected to be certified free of wild polio by early next year following an independent evaluation process, however vaccine-derived cases of the disease still pose a challenge.  ""We are confident that very soon we will be back here trumpeting the certification that countries have, once and for all, kicked polio out of Africa,"" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. Moeti attributed present progress to an ""unprecedented scale"" of multinational effort by governments, partners, and health workers, who have deployed financial and technical resources to provide vaccination and education, especially in remote areas. ""It has involved men and women volunteering in the thousands, sometimes putting themselves in harm's way,"" Moeti said. Once Africa is declared free of the disease, five of the WHO's six regions will be free of wild polio. Only what the WHO calls the Eastern Mediterranean is still fighting the disease, with polio still endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Wild vs vaccine-derived polio Cases due to the wild poliovirus found in nature have decreased by more than 99% since 1988, from an estimated 350,000 cases then, to 33 reported cases in 2018, according to the WHO.  However, outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio strains have occurred in Central African Republic, Somalia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger and Papua New Guinea in recent years. Vaccine-derived polio happens when live strains of poliovirus that are used in the oral poliovirus vaccine mutate, spread and, in rare cases, trigger an outbreak.   Most of the time the virus dies off but it can sometimes spread in an area where there is low vaccination coverage. The solution for stopping this type of polio is for every child to be vaccinated to stop its transmission, according to WHO, which has noted that if a population is fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses. The circulating vaccine-derived polio will be subject to a certification process that's separate from the wild polio process, according to WHO. This year, 65 cases of wild polio virus and 51 cases of circulating vaccine-derived polio have been recorded, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, compared to 18 cases of wild polio and 53 circulating vaccine-derived polio cases in 2018. ""Suboptimal routine immunization coverage remains a critical challenge in some countries,"" the WHO said in a statement. ""As a result, outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus -- a rare occurrence in communities with low levels of population immunity -- are still possible in several countries across Africa.""  Polio, or poliomyelitis, is transmitted person-to-person through the fecal-oral route or contaminated food. Children under 5 are most vulnerable to the disease. Symptoms of the paralyzing disease include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs. There is no cure for polio. However, it can be prevented by a vaccine. But owing to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative -- a partnership of WHO, UNICEF, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary International and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation --  only Afghanistan and Pakistan have recorded cases of wild polio virus in three years. Polio remains a problem globally and a WHO committee designated the disease a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern""  in November 2018 due to its risk of international spread. Eradication challenges In August 2016, Nigeria reported a case of wild poliovirus in the northern state of Borno two years after it had reported none.  Insecurity, conflict, migration, and parents refusing to get their children vaccinated are some challenges that hamper vaccination efforts in Nigeria, according to WHO. Dr. Oyewale Tomori, a professor of virology at Redeemer's University in Nigeria, said there were still hurdles for the Nigerian government and health monitoring agencies to cross in the country's northeast where terror group Boko Haram still wages deadly attacks, killing health workers. ""Until we can confidently say we have reached all the children in these areas were a case was found in 2016, that is when we can celebrate,"" Tomori said. Dr. Pascal Mkanda, head of the polio eradication effort in WHO's regional office for Africa said that the agency and partners have now deployed mobile technology to detect communities that have been reached by health workers and those that are left out. ""To detect a case of wild polio, we need to go to communities to see children who have symptoms and take samples but there are certain areas that there is insecurity and this poses a challenge of accessibility,"" Mkanda said. Preventing the occurrence and transmission of vaccine-derived polio needs to be a priority if the disease is to be wiped out from Africa and the rest of the world, David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said. Heymann, a former WHO representative for polio eradication, stated that though the wild virus is only occurring in two countries, others need to keep up with the disease surveillance and immunization programs to prevent a resurgence. ""If other countries let down their defense by failing to vaccinate, wild polio virus can again spread to countries that have eliminated it,"" Heymann said.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/21/health/africa-countdown-polio-eradication/index.html","2019-08-21T11:52:53Z","2019-08-21T15:03:15Z","2019-08-21T15:03:15Z","cnn","By Bukola Adebayo, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150819104026-spc-vital-signs-polio-vaccines-b-00014526-story-body.jpg"
"55","CBP will not vaccinate migrants against flu","article","US Customs and Border Protection will not vaccinate migrants, even though three children who had been in US custody died after contracting the flu. The cases all occurred since December. ""In general, due to the short-term nature of CBP holding and the complexities of operating vaccination programs, neither CBP nor its medical contractors administer vaccinations to those in our custody,"" according to a statement Tuesday from CBP. Migrants are supposed to held in CBP custody for 72 hours or less, but often remain there for longer. After leaving CBP custody, children without parents are sent into the care of the US Department of Health and Human Services, where flu vaccines are distributed, according to Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a part of HHS. Public health experts had strong reactions to CBP's statement, saying the department should be able to vaccinate migrants, even if they're in CBP custody for only a few days. ""I think their answer is completely inappropriate,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and an adviser the US Centers for Disease Control and Protection. ""They ought to be able to do this. They create facilities that encourage the spread of infectious agents, with flu at the top of the list."" Flu activity in the United States typically begins to increase around October and many US pharmacies already have flu vaccines available.  Children younger than 5, and especially those younger than 2, are at high risk of serious flu-related complications, according to the CDC. Flu seasons vary in severity, but thousands of children are hospitalized each year related to the flu, and some children die. A flu vaccine offers the best defense against getting flu and spreading it to others, the CDC said. Concern about contagious diseases On August 5, two members of Congress wrote a letter to the heads of the US Department of Homeland Security and HHS expressing concern about contagious diseases. ""When we visited the Homestead detention facility on July 15, 2019, we left with serious questions about the screening, treatment, isolation, and prevention protocols of infectious diseases, particularly influenza,"" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, and Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, a Democrat from California, wrote to Kevin McAleenan, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. DeLauro and Roybal-Allard also sent McAleenan and Azar a letter from physicians at Harvard and Johns Hopkins urging vaccinations. ""During the influenza season, vaccination should be offered to all detainees promptly upon arrival in order to maximize protection for the youngest and most vulnerable detainees,"" the physicians wrote.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/health/cbp-migrant-vaccinations-bn/index.html","2019-08-20T19:19:41Z","2019-08-20T19:19:41Z","2019-08-20T19:19:41Z","cnn","By Elizabeth Cohen and John Bonifield, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181227151123-01-felipe-gomez-alonzo-story-body.jpg"
"56","UK steps up fight after losing 'measles-free' status","article","The United Kingdom says it will take steps to halt the spread of misinformation about vaccines as a result of losing its ""measles-free"" status after the highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in the country three years ago. Measles, which is almost entirely preventable with two doses of vaccine, is making a comeback globally. In the first half of the year, there have been almost three times as many cases as the same time last year. Cases globally are at the highest level since 2006, according to the World Health Organization. ""After a period of progress where we were once able to declare Britain measles free, we've now seen hundreds of cases of measles in the UK this year. One case of this horrible disease is too many, and I am determined to step up our efforts to tackle its spread,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.  ""This is a global challenge and there's a number of reasons why people don't get themselves or their children the vaccines they need, but we need decisive action across our health service and society to make sure communities are properly immunized."" Johnson said that that he would summon social media companies ""to discuss how they can play their part in promoting accurate information about vaccination."" He also said people would be encouraged to have catch-up vaccinations. Social media has made it easier for vaccine opponents to operate although the pushback on immunization among some groups isn't the only reason behind the upsurge in the disease. Poor access to quality health care, displacement due to conflict, complacency and a lack of awareness also play big roles, according to WHO.  In Europe there have been close to 90,000 cases reported for the first six months of this year, exceeding those recorded for the whole of 2018, while the United States has reported its highest measles case count in 25 years, according to WHO. Mandatory jabs The UK isn't the only country taking steps to stop the spread of the disease,  which can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Last month, Germany made measles jabs mandatory for children entering school or kindergarten. Parents will be required to provide evidence that their child has been vaccinated before they are enrolled, and will face fines of up to 2,500 euros ($2,800) if they fail to do so. Johnson called for renewed efforts to meet the 95% WHO target for both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella.  While the UK meets the target for the first dose of the jab, currently, only 87% of children in the UK are getting their second dose, which has likely contributed to the spread of measles.  The UK was deemed to have eliminated measles by the WHO in 2017, based on data from 2014-2016, according to Public Health England, a government body.  In countries that have eliminated measles, measles cases can still occur, but these will be isolated cases that only have limited spread within the community -- typically meaning only outbreaks that had started abroad and were then passed on. However, in 2018, there was a marked increase in the number of confirmed measles cases, with 991 confirmed cases in England and Wales, compared with 284 cases in 2017.  According to the WHO, in 2019 there were 489 confirmed cases in the UK as of August 7.  Furthermore, the same strain of measles virus (called B3 Dublin) was detected for more than 12 months across 2017 and 2018, the body said.  ""Based on this, WHO determined that the UK could no longer be consider as 'eliminated' and that transmission of measles had been re-established,""  Public Health England said.  ""Losing our 'measles-free' status is a stark reminder of how important it is that every eligible person gets vaccinated. Elimination can only be sustained by maintaining and improving coverage of the MMR vaccine,"" added Dr. Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at Public Health England. WHO has deemed vaccine hesitancy -- the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines -- a top 10 threat to global health in 2019. ""We are still suffering from the now entirely debunked MMR scandal of the nineties, and it is potentially disastrous that as a result so many young people are now susceptible to serious, often life-threatening infectious diseases, such as measles, that we could have completely eradicated in this country if this had never happened,"" said Prof. Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners. ""People who were not vaccinated as children need to understand that it is not too late to have their MMR jab and we would urge them to do so."" Numerous studies have dismissed claims that measles vaccinations cause or trigger autism.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/health/measles-uk-who-intl/index.html","2019-08-19T12:15:43Z","2019-08-19T12:15:43Z","2019-08-19T12:15:43Z","cnn","By Katie Hunt, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502192608-measles-story-body.jpg"
"57","Don't pet the cat: My rabies education and the big bill that followed","article","I was just petting an orange tabby cat in my Falls Church, Virginia, neighborhood, a cat I never met before. He was very cute. And he was purring and butting his head against my hand. Until he wasn't. He sunk his teeth into my wrist, hissed at me and ran off. So began my personal episode of Law & Order: Feline Victims Unit, complete with cat mug shots and weekly check-ins from local animal control and public health officials. And rabies shots. Multiple rabies shots in the emergency room. And more than $26,000 in health care costs, an alarming amount considering I was perfectly healthy throughout the whole ordeal. What I learned, besides fascinating facts about rabies, its transmission and the horrible ways one can die from it, was that how any one of us is a mere cat scratch away from financial peril if we aren't lucky enough to have good health insurance. Our confusing health care system makes it too easy for a person who should get medical care to postpone it or avoid it — even when that decision could be fatal. After the encounter with the cat, I headed to a nearby storefront urgent care clinic, where a nurse handed me a form to fill out, which the city uses to track animal bites. She faxed the form to the health department and a police officer visited me as soon as I returned home. I was asked: ""Do you know the cat?"" After some sleuthing in my neighborhood Facebook group, I developed a suspicion about whom he belongs to. But I couldn't be 100% positive. Which is why three days after the bite I was in the waiting room in the emergency room. When an animal bites someone, the procedure is to quarantine it for 10 days. If the animal doesn't develop rabies symptoms during that time, it's safe to say the bite victim won't develop the disease either. But if the animal can't be identified or captured, the recommendation is to begin post-exposure preventive treatment for rabies. I'd need a one-time injection of human rabies immune globulin and then four injections of the rabies vaccine over two weeks. An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 people get such treatments each year following exposure to potentially rabid animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I did consider taking my chances and skipping treatment. The odds the cat that bit me was rabid were, I'd guess, almost zero. He was probably someone's pet and didn't appear to have any symptoms. But rabies is fatal. That was the line my doctor, the animal control officer, my friends and public health officials kept repeating. A small chance is not the same as no chance. I tried to be a responsible health care consumer and research cost-effective options. The ER is the only place that can administer immune globulin, so I knew that was my first stop. But I hoped to go elsewhere for the next three appointments, where I would receive the rabies vaccine. I sat on the phone with insurance company agents while they tried to find an in-network provider that stocked the rabies vaccine. They found nothing. My primary care doctor told me people generally ended up doing the follow-up doses in the ER. The urgent care clinic staff told me they didn't keep the vaccine in stock but could have ordered it ahead of time if they had known I would need it. Since I hadn't anticipated being bitten by a cat, I neglected to call ahead. The staff at the ER told me that specialized clinics for travelers can administer the vaccine, but the procedure is not generally covered by insurance. Also, to adhere to the strict vaccination schedule, I needed a location with Sunday hours, which I was unable to find. The Fairfax County, Virginia, public health department said the county does not administer rabies vaccines at its clinics. Two hospital urgent care clinics also told me they couldn't provide the vaccine, even though one of those clinics is on the same campus as the ER. Which left me back where I started. Although my insurance picked up the full tab for that first emergency room visit, the hospital bill came to $17,294.17. My insurance provider negotiated that bill down to $898 and paid it. For the next three visits, I received doses of RabAvert, made by GlaxoSmithKline. Even though I received the same treatment for each of these visits, the hospital billed my insurance slightly different amounts each time: $2,810.96, $2,692.86 and $2,084.36. (If I could have bought it from a pharmacy, it would have cost about $350 a dose.) Rabies is not the only possible complication of a cat bite. Many bites become infected, which is why I left my urgent care visit with a 10-day supply of amoxicillin, an antibiotic. According to the police, the cat who bit me is likely a repeat offender. A neighbor recently developed a nasty infection after a bite from a large orange tabby -- no one is sure if it is the same cat -- and has since needed surgery. She also underwent the rabies treatment. I was lucky not to develop an infection, but my insurance company did have to pay one final bill — $206 to see my primary doctor after I developed a rash, likely from the antibiotic. If you're keeping score at home, that brings the grand total to $26,229.35. I had hoped to donate my blood, now rich with rabies antibodies, to be used to create more immune globulin for future bite victims. Unfortunately, my level of immunity likely isn't high enough. Most people who give their plasma for this purpose have undergone the rabies vaccine many times. A public health worker said he recommended plasma donation to an acquaintance of his who studies endangered bats -- a career I'm unlikely to go into. In fact, if I get bitten by any wildlife in the future, I will still have to trek back to the ER for two more rounds of shots. So, I leave this experience behind with modestly increased immunity, little understanding of how medical bills are calculated and a new fear of outdoor cats — but also with a new appreciation for public health workers. As for the cat, the police told me he's under house arrest.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/health/rabies-treatment-bill-khn-partner/index.html","2019-08-16T11:05:22Z","2019-08-16T11:05:22Z","2019-08-16T11:05:22Z","cnn","By Caitlin Hillyard, Kaiser Health News","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180617021824-bobcat-attack-story-body.jpg"
"58","Marianne Williamson promoted anti-vaxxer theories on her radio show in 2012 episode","article","Democratic presidential candidate and author Marianne Williamson once gave a platform to the unfounded theory that vaccines are linked to autism and called on her audience to ""be awake"" and ""do your due diligence"" before making the decision to vaccinate their children. In a January 2012 episode of her radio show, ""Living Miracuously,"" reviewed by CNN's KFile, Williamson said she ""agonized"" as a mother over the decision to vaccinate her children and that she could see ""both sides"" of the issue.  Her guest, author Gwen Olsen, said on the program that she knew a number of people who were vaccinated and were later diagnosed with autism, to which Williamson responded, ""Yes, absolutely."" A spokesman for Williamson told CNN she was neutral on the program, saying, ""As with any radio show host, Williamson spoke with a variety of guests from all walks of life and some were provocative. This guest had a specific point of view on the issue, but it's clear from Williamson's comments that she was neutral. For example, when someone like Kellyanne Conway is interviewed on CNN, we don't assume the host agrees with everything she says.""  Williamson's comments on vaccines shed new light on positions she has downplayed since running for president. Williamson issued an apology earlier this year after calling mandatory vaccines ""Orwellian"" and ""draconian,"" writing in a tweet that she understood ""many vaccines are important and save lives."" Williamson described herself in an interview with MSNBC as ""pro-vaccination, pro-medicine, pro-science."" But her comments on her radio program in 2012  show that she was willing to entertain and give credence to claims about vaccines that have been roundly criticized as unfounded and dangerous by scientists and medical professionals.  In the episode, Williamson interviewed Olsen, the author of ""Confessions of an RX Drug Pusher."" The book details Olsen's 15-year career in the pharmaceutical industry, along with her family's own mental health medical history, until she turned on pharmaceuticals, particularly antidepressants. Williamson said she had ""never been more enthusiastic about a show,"" calling it ""one of the most important programs you could ever hear"" for anyone who had taken prescription drugs or anti-depressants. Williamson invited on a prescreened caller with a question on vaccines. The caller, a pregnant woman who identified as Kristin from San Jose, California, said she had avoided vaccinating her 3-year-old daughter by not taking her to the doctor. The caller acknowledged the problem of viruses like smallpox and polio, that have been mostly eradicated by vaccines, but wondered what she should do about vaccinating her kids. ""Let's have Gwen answer,"" Williamson said. ""I'm curious myself, Gwen, I know I agonized as a mother on this topic."" In the discussion, Olsen said she knew people whose children were diagnosed with autism after receiving vaccinations. ""I don't have the medical authority to make those kinds of recommendations, but I do know a number of people that have had children that have become diagnosed with autism,"" Olsen added. Williamson responded affirmatively to the remark. ""Yeah, I know,"" Williamson said. ""Yes, absolutely. And I know that one, too. And I have a friend who had the same experience. So I know it's huge and I think all I'm calling for in this program is for everybody to be awake and really do your due diligence and do your research.""  There is no evidence for the debunked claim that mercury previously used in vaccines was linked to the development of autism -- a claim Olsen also makes in her book.  Earlier in the discussion, Olsen told the caller she had vaccinated all her children, but wished she had not. ""If I had to do it over again, I would not,"" Olsen said, adding that she disputed the scientific consensus that herd immunity -- the idea that many people getting vaccinated leads to fewer people getting sick and thus fewer germs to spread -- protects people from getting infected. ""So I guess without getting too controversial, I would say I would do my own due diligence if I were you,"" Olsen said. ""I know lots and lots of chiropractors. I have over 4,000 chiropractors in my network and I know that they do not vaccinate their children. And I know lots of chiropractors with healthy children that are in fact have higher IQs than many of the children that are vaccinated and they don't suffer from all of the ear infections and all of the chronic problems that a lot of the children that are vaccinated do.""  Olsen said the expert she would consult would be Dr. Sherri Tenpenny -- an anti-vaccine osteopath who pushes discredited theories on vaccines and had to cancel a planned tour in Australia due to backlash to her views.  ""And the expert on the vaccines that I would send you to would be Dr. Sherri Tenpenny and she is -- you can visit her website,"" Olsen said. ""But Dr. Sherri and I worked together occasionally and we are colleagues and she is the vaccine expert and that is the person that I would be the go-to person for if I were you."" Williamson added, ""I want to reiterate about each of us doing our own due diligence."" ""I personally, and I'm not an expert, but just as another mother who was another parent who has dealt with this and had to really agonize over that decision, I sort of see both -- you know, not coming from any kind of a medical or professional perspective, but just as a person -- I see both sides on that one,"" she said.  ""I wouldn't presume to make anyone else's decision for them, but I think everybody needs to do your own due diligence on that one.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/kfile-marianne-williamson-anti-vaxxer-theories/index.html","2019-08-15T14:07:47Z","2019-08-16T05:56:13Z","2019-08-16T05:56:13Z","cnn","By Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck, CNN","politics","POLITICS","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190730214640-marianne-williamson-2020-cnn-democratic-primary-debate-story-body.jpg"
"59","Israeli flight attendant dies after contracting measles","article","An Israeli flight attendant and mother of three has died of measles. Rotem Amitai, 43, died Tuesday, according to Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva, Israel. Amitai had traveled from New York to Tel Aviv a few days before developing a fever in March, but it's not clear whether she was infected on a flight, in New York or in Israel, according to Israel's Ministry of Health.  Amitai was vaccinated against the disease as a child, but like many people her age around the world, she received only one dose of the vaccine. She was otherwise healthy before contracting measles.  ""Rotem was a wonderful woman and a devoted mother. We are grieving and mourning her passing before her time,"" her family said in a statement. Amitai's death from measles was confirmed by the Emek Hefer Regional Council, a local governmental authority in Israel. On March 26, Amitai flew from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to Tel Aviv, according to El Al airline, her employer.  She developed a fever March 31 and then slipped into a coma about a week later. She was diagnosed with encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, a complication of measles. ""El Al mourns the death of a member of the airline's flight crew. We have taken steps to have our air crews inoculated,"" the airline said in a statement. ""We extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved family and will continue to stand by them.""   More than 360,000 people worldwide have contracted measles this year as of August 7, according to the World Health Organization. That data is provisional and includes both suspected and confirmed cases. In 2017, there were 110,000 measles deaths globally, mostly among children under the age of 5, according to WHO. Measles deaths are rare in Israel and the United States, but both places are experiencing outbreaks of the virus. Health authorities blame the measles outbreaks in recent years on people who refuse to get vaccinated. There have been 4,300 cases of measles in Israel since March 2018. In the United States, measles was declared eliminated in 2000, but the recent resurgence -- more than 1,100 cases this year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- has threatened that status. More than 75% of the cases have been in New York. ""We have the reintroduction of a serious viral infection with a population that's withholding the vaccine from their children, and now it's spreading beyond that population,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and an adviser on vaccines to the CDC.   One dose of the measles vaccine has been found to be about 93% effective. In 1989, children in the United States started receiving two doses, which is about 97% effective, according to the CDC. It's not known why most people who get measles recover fully while others have devastating complications.   About 1 out of every 1,000 children who gets measles will develop encephalitis, according to the CDC. This can lead to convulsions and leave a child deaf or with an intellectual disability. Additionally, 1 or 2 out of 1,000 US children who get measles will die from it. Worldwide, the illness is fatal in 1 or 2 out of every 100 children. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in the early 1960s, an estimated 400 to 500 people in the United States died of the disease each year, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 1,000 developed encephalitis, according to the CDC.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/health/israeli-flight-attendant-measles-death/index.html","2019-08-13T21:23:33Z","2019-08-14T04:25:40Z","2019-08-14T04:25:40Z","cnn","By Elizabeth Cohen, CNN Senior Medical Correspondent","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502192608-measles-story-body.jpg"
"60","A chlamydia vaccine shows signs of success in an early trial","article","Scientists have taken a step towards a vaccine for chlamydia following a successful early trial. A vaccine developed by a British and Danish team was shown to be safe and effective during a randomized controlled trial involving 35 women, according to a study published in medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world. There are 131 million new cases every year, according to Imperial College London, with as many as three-quarters showing no symptoms. However it can cause infertility if left untreated. The researchers, from Imperial College London, UK, and the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), Denmark, acknowledge that the development of the vaccine has a long way to go. It had however produced the immune response they had hoped for, and none of the women developed any serious side effects. ""The most important result is that we have seen protective antibodies against chlamydia in the genital tracts,"" said study author Frank Follmann of SSI in a statement. ""Our initial trials show them preventing the chlamydia bacteria from penetrating the cells of the body. This means that we have come a lot closer to a vaccine against chlamydia."" This is the first clinical trial for a vaccine for genital chlamydia and represents the latest development in 15 years of research, according to an SSI statement. However there remains a lot of work to be done, according to study author Robin Shattock of Imperial College. ""The next step is to take the vaccine forward to further trials, but until that's done, we won't know whether it is truly protective or not,"" he said in a statement from Imperial College. Diagnostic tests and antibiotic treatments are available, but national treatment programs have had little effect in fighting the global chlamydia epidemic, according to press release from The Lancet. Study authors suggest a vaccine could be the best way to fight the infection. One in every six women infected with chlamydia develops pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy or infertility. Chlamydia infection increases susceptibility to other STIs and infection during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth, according to the statement. ""Given the impact of the chlamydia epidemic on women's health, reproductive health, infant health through vertical transmission, and increased susceptibility to other sexually transmitted diseases, a global unmet medical need exists for a vaccine against genital chlamydia,"" said study author Peter Andersen of SSI. Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, said further research is needed as this trial looked primarily at the safety of the vaccine in healthy adults. ""More trials will be needed to find out if these immune responses are capable of preventing Chlamydia infection in people who have been exposed,"" Gilbert told CNN. It is not clear how soon a chlamydia vaccine could be used in the general population, according to Gilbert. ""It depends a lot on how much funding is available to continue with the vaccine development which will get more expensive at every stage,"" said Gilbert. While it is scientifically possible for a vaccine to be made available in five years, it is common for vaccines to spend 10 or 20 years in development, she explained. It also depends on the manufacturing capacity of SSI, which produced the vaccine used in the trial. ""Will they be able to manufacture enough for the vaccine to be marketed, or will it need to be transferred to another manufacturer?"" said Gilbert.  ""That will have implications for the time to vaccine licensure."" In June, the World Health Organization (WHO) released figures showing more than one million new cases of STIs are contracted every day. The four infections are chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis (or ""trich"") and syphilis.  An average of one in every 25 people globally has at least one of these STIs, according to the WHO.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/health/chlamydia-vaccine-trial-scli-intl/index.html","2019-08-13T10:55:38Z","2019-08-13T14:15:26Z","2019-08-13T14:15:26Z","cnn","By Jack Guy, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150210154413-vaccines-2-cfb-story-body.jpg"
"61","West Nile virus cases rose in the US in 2018, killing 167 people","article","The number of West Nile virus cases rose across the United States last year, killing 167 people, according to data released Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say the increase, while small, underscores the need to protect against mosquitoes during the hot summer months. There were 2,647 cases of West Nile virus last year, the CDC said, which is 550 more cases than the year before. The virus's most severe form -- neuroinvasive disease, which can cause inflammation in the brain -- was also more common last year than in years prior, according to the agency. ""I think [the report] confirms and says again that this is a significant problem in the US, that we have a couple thousand people getting very serious neurologic infections,"" said Dr. Mark Mulligan, director of the division of infectious diseases and immunology at the NYU Langone School of Medicine.  The increase in cases was modest, he said, and ""there have been some years within those past years that have been this high, so I think there's fluctuation year-to-year."" Still, ""what the report tells us is, as in years past, West Nile virus is the most frequent cause of neuroinvasive disease."" Cases reported across the country The new data also reveals changes in where infections are found, said Sadie Ryan, an associate professor of medical geography at the University of Florida. ""It's up a little bit,"" she said, ""but places that previously had really large numbers have less than they did, like Arizona and California."" Those are states ""with historically large numbers of cases,"" according to the CDC. One explanation for the geographic shifts, Ryan said, could be that previously impacted regions are better prepared to track and control mosquitoes. ""In places where it first popped up, it's now part of the surveillance and control efforts, so we know when to detect it, people know to spray themselves and dump their water,"" she said. ""It started in New York, in the Northeast, and then over the last roughly 20 years it has spread all the way across the country,"" said Mulligan, the NYU professor.  Last year, there were just 278 neuroinvasive infections in all of New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, Illinois alone saw 126 cases, while Texas reported 108. In states long impacted by infections, like New York, people likely have greater protective immunity against the disease, Mulligan said. Only about 1 in 150 people with West Nile virus develop serious illness, according to the CDC, meaning that many cases are asymptomatic but still protect against future infection. ""A lot of people are getting infected and have no symptoms at all,"" Mulligan said.  ""What happens is that a population develops herd immunity,"" he added. ""Populations as a whole become relatively immune, and so the numbers of cases, as shown [in this report], are lower in many areas."" The highest incidences of infection in 2018, for example, were in Nebraska and the Dakotas. States like those ""are probably areas where, in past years, there hasn't yet been a real heavy infection, so there's a higher proportion of non-immune, susceptible individuals."" How to protect against mosquito-borne disease For those who are affected by West Nile virus, the consequences can be severe and even deadly. People over 60 years old are at greater risk for severe symptoms, which can include high fever, paralysis and even coma. Among those who develop serious illness affecting the central nervous system, about 10% die, and in those who survive, damage can be permanent.  West Nile is transmitted by mosquitoes, making it an arbovirus -- a type of virus transmitted by bugs. There is currently no vaccine, so controlling mosquitoes is the best way to prevent infection, said Ryan, the University of Florida professor. ""Prevention is really about protecting yourself,"" she said. ""So long sleeves, long pants, bug spray, and thinking about when mosquitoes are out."" Being outside around dusk may be nice, Ryan said, but that's when mosquitoes are most likely to bite. The CDC also tracked other arboviruses, including the tick-borne Powassan virus, which can infect the brain and lead to death. Last year, the CDC saw its first reported case of Powassan transmitted person-to-person through a blood transfusion, and the rare disease recently killed one New York resident. The US also saw 86 cases of La Crosse virus last year. The infection is spread by mosquitoes, according to the CDC, and can lead to inflammation of the brain, seizures and paralysis. Severe disease occurs most often in children, the agency says. ""More La Crosse virus disease cases were actually reported in the 2018 data than in any year since 2011, and it's the most common cause of neuroinvasive arboviral disease in children,"" said Ryan. ""People who are scared about their kids getting nasty diseases should be thinking about La Crosse."" Why the CDC has been receiving more reports of the virus, though, remains unclear.  ""It may be increasing,"" Ryan said, ""or we may be improving detection of cases.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/west-nile-virus-cases-rise-cdc/index.html","2019-08-09T06:11:07Z","2019-08-09T06:11:07Z","2019-08-09T06:11:07Z","cnn","By Arman Azad, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160511071735-mosquito-prevention-weather-orig-00002013-story-body.jpg"
"62","Philippines declares a national dengue epidemic after 622 deaths","article","A national dengue epidemic has been declared in the Philippines, where 622 people have died of the mosquito-borne disease since January and millions more are at risk. From the start of the year to July 20, there have been more than 146,000 cases recorded -- a 98% increase from the same time period last year, according to the country's Department of Health. Dengue causes flu-like symptoms, including piercing headaches, muscle and joint pains, fever and full body rashes. Of the millions of people infected every year worldwide, an estimated 500,000 develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization, and of those some 12,500 people die, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The Philippines had declared a national dengue alert just last month after reporting more than 450 deaths -- but officials had said the dengue was ""localized,"" according to CNN affiliate CNN Philippines. With almost two hundred additional deaths in the past month, the crisis has now escalated to a national epidemic. The epidemic was declared in order to enable government agencies to better identify at risk areas, said a health ministry statement. ""It is important that a national epidemic be declared in these areas to identify where a localized response is needed, and to enable the local government units to use their Quick Response Fund to address the epidemic situation,"" said Health Secretary Francisco Duque in the statement.  Epidemics have been declared in seven out of the country's 17 regions: Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, and Northern Mindanao. Together, these regions are home to more than 40 million people, about 40% of the Philippines population. Several other regions like Central Visayas and Ilocos are at high risk with thousands of cases reported, though not yet past the epidemic threshold. ""As part of our data, is 5,100 cases per week average,"" said Duque at a press conference about the epidemic on Wednesday. ""This is really staggering. This is going to be a record number."" Since July, health officials have worked to combat the spread of the viral infection. They deployed hundreds of doctors and nurses to provincial and district hospitals, and provided emergency funding to affected regions, among other measures, according to the Department of Health. The Philippines became the first country in Asia to approve the use of the Dengvaxia vaccine, the world's first and only licensed dengue vaccine made by French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi Pateur, in 2016.  The drug was distributed to more than 800,000 students as part of school-based government immunization program, but was suspended in 2017 after clinical trial data showed that it could have unintended consequences in non-infected patients.  Despite the epidemic, the  government has no immediate plans to reintroduce the vaccine to the public, Mark Timbal, spokesperson for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council told CNN Wednesday.  Timbal said the adverse effects of Dengvaxia were still being investigated by the government and in the meantime, efforts would focus on the removal or destruction of mosquito breeding sites, in collaboration with schools, communities, and local governments.   Dengue cases in the Philippines have historically surged every three to four years, and the sharp increase this year is in line with expectations after a 2016 spike, Duque said last month. These spikes aren't isolated to just the Philippines, either -- last week, more than 1,000 people in Bangladesh were diagnosed with dengue in a 24-hour period, and hospitals are now overflowing with patients.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/health/philippines-dengue-epidemic-intl-hnk/index.html","2019-08-07T05:18:28Z","2019-08-07T05:49:42Z","2019-08-07T05:49:42Z","cnn","By Jessie Yeung and Sarah Faidell, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151124141940-malaria-mosquito-anopheles-stephensi-story-body.jpg"
"63","The battle against Ebola is far from over","article","On Wednesday, a second person died of Ebola virus disease in the city of Goma, a major transit center on the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda. This news serves as a stark reminder that our battle against this formidable disease is far from over.     Five years ago this week, Emory University Hospital stepped forward to accept its first patient with Ebola virus disease, Dr. Kent Brantly. In the midst of the largest outbreak since the disease was first recognized in 1976, Emory provided care to Brantly and three additional health care workers in our Serious Communicable Diseases Unit -- at the time one of just four high-level biocontainment wards in the United States.   But serious challenges remain. This week also marks one year since the most recent Ebola outbreak began in the DRC. Fortunately, we now have a powerful new vaccine to help fight the disease. It will have limited impact, however, if members of affected communities are reluctant to be immunized. As of July 28, the World Health Organization has reported 2,671 cases in the latest outbreak, with 1,790 confirmed deaths from the disease. Care of these patients also puts health care workers at heightened risk.  The WHO has declared Ebola a ""public health emergency of international concern."" Women and children are especially vulnerable. As of July 23, the WHO reports that 56% of the total confirmed and probable cases were female, and approximately 29% were children under 18 years of age. While Ebola virus disease does not discriminate, the risks borne by women are increased by sociocultural factors, including serving as primary caregivers to those who are sick or dying. As communities cope with the sorrow of loss, many individuals must simultaneously fear infection by a devastating virus.   And these concerns have an impact beyond Ebola virus disease. As our planet warms and global resources are stretched thin, we can expect that human beings will come into greater contact with highly infectious pathogens. Our world's forests are being cut down at an astonishing rate. Last year alone, approximately 30 million acres of tropical forest were lost. Scientists tell us that as deforestation continues and disease-carrying animals are displaced, we are losing our protective barrier against infectious diseases that, until now, have remained largely isolated in the forests. The question is not if another special pathogen outbreak will occur. It's when.   Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit is focused on preparation and prevention. This week, our university hosted a conference to assess where we've come in the past five years and to look ahead to the future. Working alongside courageous partners, we have made important strides in patient care and safety, including a new project assessing the feasibility of training health care workers to use special reusable respirators during a respiratory pathogen pandemic. Emory physicians have even pioneered new research into eye complications related to Ebola that can linger long after the patient has recovered.    To combat this latest Ebola outbreak -- and to confront the broader challenges of public health for tomorrow -- we must look toward comprehensive approaches that are driven by members of affected communities and supported by those who have the knowledge or means to make a lasting difference. Working together, we can build trust and prepare for what comes next. Doing so is a matter of global human rights. Our shared future depends on it.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/opinions/battle-against-ebola-far-from-over-opinion-sterk/index.html","2019-08-02T17:15:23Z","2019-08-02T17:15:23Z","2019-08-02T17:15:23Z","cnn","By Claire E.

"64","Philadelphia declares a public health emergency after surge of Hepatitis A","article","The Philadelphia Department of Health has declared a public health emergency due to a surge in Hepatitis A, Dr. Thomas A. Farley, Health Commissioner of the City, said Thursday. So far this year, 154 people have tested positive for the highly contagious liver disease, with 85% of diagnoses occurring since May, the department said. Typically, the city sees between two and nine cases each year. Preliminary information indicates 67% of people who have been diagnosed with Hepatitis A say they have used drugs, while 26% report homelessness, according to health officials. All but four of the confirmed cases have occurred in adults. ""While there's not an exact cause that we can pinpoint, Philadelphia had been in the grip of the opioid crisis, which the Health Commissioner had called the worst epidemic here in more than a century,"" James Garrow, spokesman for Philadelphia Department of Public Health, told CNN in an email. Garrow said the bulk of cases have occurred among at-risk populations in the northern neighborhood of Kensington. ""We've seen, in other cities, similar outbreaks tied to homelessness and illicit drug use so believe this outbreak is the same,"" he added. ""There hasn't been a specific change, just a bad situation that has been going for a while."" Viral symptoms Caused by a virus, Hepatitis A is an infection that people pick up either by coming into contact with human waste or by consuming contaminated food or water. Unwashed hands and unsanitary conditions help spread the disease. Fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, joint pain and jaundice (yellow skin or eyes and dark urine) are symptoms, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms usually appear two to six weeks after infection and last less than two months. Southern New Jersey and suburban Pennsylvania counties around Philadelphia are also reporting higher than usual numbers of Hepatitis A among the same at-risk populations, according to the city's health department.   The Hepatitis A vaccine requires two doses given at least six months apart for long-lasting protection, according to the CDC. Since last summer, 12,439 vaccinations have been dispensed to adults in Philadelphia. The city has distributed more than 4,000 personal hygiene items, including hand sanitizer, soap, tissue packets and condoms, to at-risk populations.  ""Despite these aggressive and extensive efforts, Hepatitis A virus is spreading rapidly and is expected to continue doing so, thereby necessitating further action... and expanded resources to control this epidemic,"" wrote Farley. In response to the emergency, Philadelphia will offer free vaccinations for at-risk populations including the homeless, drug users, people recently incarcerated, men who have sex with men, and people with chronic liver disease, Farley said. Close contacts of those who are infected will also be eligible. Context for the crisis The 2017 Hepatitis A epidemic in San Diego County, California, included 592 infections, primarily among the homeless and illegal drug users. Twenty people died, wrote Farley in his statement. The California epidemic was controlled by increased vaccination and improved sanitation, Farley said. Based on its annual ""Point in Time"" count, Philadelphia has experienced rising rates of homelessness over the past few years, according to CNN affiliate KYW.  The year 2017 saw a 36% increase over the prior year, followed by a 13% jump in 2018. This year's increase was 5%. Meanwhile, illicit drug use rates, which can be difficult to gauge, may also be rising. Almost half of people admitted to treatment reported using heroin as their primary drug. That is a 26% increase from 2016, according to one recent government report.

"65","Kentucky doctor reprimanded after his wife improperly handled flu vaccines and wrote prescriptions under his name","article","A Kentucky doctor's medical license was placed on probation for five years after his wife improperly handled flu vaccines and wrote prescriptions under his name, according to Kentucky's medical licensing board. The state Board of Medical Licensure ordered Dr. Paul McLaughlin's medical license to be placed on probation after multiple patients reported nodules appearing after receiving a flu shot in October and November 2018. The patients were given the shots at the Location Vaccination clinic in Mount Sterling, about 35 miles east of Lexington, which is owned and operated by McLaughlin's wife, according to the order. After the clinic received calls reporting adverse reactions from at least 16 patients, McLaughlin's wife, Fairshinda McLaughlin, began prescribing short-term antibiotics to treat the reactions, the order said. The antibiotics were prescribed under Dr. Paul McLaughlin's name and without the patients being physically assessed, according to the order. Paul McLaughlin was fined $5,000 and must reimburse the board $1,793.75, the order said. He also must pass a course addressing medical ethics and misconduct, complete five hours of continuing medical education on vaccine administration and create a written policy for storage and administration of vaccines and protocols should adverse reactions occur, according to the order. The board issued the order after hearing a report from the Kentucky Department of Public Health, which said the outbreak of adverse reactions was ""likely due to the preparation, storage and/or handling practices"" at the clinic. KDPH also said that the clinic's operator and those who handled and administered the vaccines were all unlicensed medical professionals. Paul McLaughlin appeared before a medical licensing board panel on June 20, 2019, and said he and his wife became aware of the outbreak of adverse reactions during Thanksgiving week of 2018. But the board noted that many of the prescriptions were written before Thanksgiving. The board also said in its order that records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the clinic contacted the CDC on November 5, 2018, and reported  that 16 patients had abscess nodules nearly a month after receiving the flu shot.  The board order says the caller was told to contact the Kentucky Immunization Program in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, to submit a report but a report was never submitted. CDC records showed that a clinic staffer called the CDC on November 13 and asked if the CDC could test the needles to see if there were any issues with the equipment used to administer the vaccines. The CDC told the caller that syringes could be submitted to local, county or state health department for testing but nothing was submitted for testing.  By December, at least three patients were treated by the Clark County Health Department for reactions from the vaccinations they received at Location Vaccination. The department reported the reactions to the Montgomery County Health Department, which contacted the medical office and confirmed there was an outbreak of adverse reactions, but no information had been reported to VAERS. KDPH then interviewed Paul McLaughlin about the reactions. He confirmed that he was aware of the reactions and that he had received a vaccination and suffered a reaction that resolved with antibiotic treatment. He also said the CDC was contacted but it ""wasn't really interested."" In December 2018, KDPH sent a letter about the outbreak of reactions to patients who may have been injected with the vaccine. The department then began receiving calls from patients saying the doctor's wife was contacting them directly and calling in prescriptions for antibiotics and steroids without any physical assessment or testing.  If antibiotics are prescribed inappropriately, there could be serious consequences, the order said. According to KDPH, it was unclear whether Paul McLaughlin knew that his wife was calling in prescriptions, but the prescriptions were submitted under his name and license. The medical licensing board said McLaughlin had delegated his medical responsibilities to an unlicensed medical professional and his failure to address the outbreak of adverse reactions had contributed to a public health crisis. According to the order, Paul McLaughlin denied that he had delegated his medical responsibilities or reacted inappropriately to the vaccination reactions. In a statement, an attorney for McLaughlin denied any wrongdoing on the doctor's part and suggested the adverse reactions could have been a result of ""well recognized side-effects associated with most vaccines."" The attorney's statement also said the board has not restricted the doctor's license but sets out the ""unproven accusation of others."" According to the order, if the board determines that Paul McLaughlin has violated any terms of the order, he may face additional punishment, including having his license revoked.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/23/health/kentucky-vaccines-outbreak/index.html","2019-07-23T13:48:30Z","2019-07-23T13:48:30Z","2019-07-23T13:48:30Z","cnn","By Rebekah Riess and Hollie Silverman, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190507151246-flu-vaccine-file-story-body.jpg"
"66","Trump claims US could 'win' war in Afghanistan in a week during meeting with Pakistani PM","article","President Donald Trump said the US has made ""a lot of progress"" toward ending the war in Afghanistan in negotiations with the Taliban in recent weeks and made clear his disdain for the US' ongoing US military presence in Afghanistan. Welcoming Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan to the Oval Office on Monday, Trump diminished the US' 18-year war in Afghanistan as one where the US has ""acted as policemen, not soldiers"" and suggested the US could swiftly end it through brute military strength that would leave ""10 million people"" dead. That option, he said, is not one he intends to pursue. ""I have plans on Afghanistan that if I wanted to win that war, Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the earth, it would be over in literally in 10 days and I don't want to do that -- I don't want to go that route,"" the President said. Trump at several points suggested he had been presented with a plan that would win the US war in Afghanistan in 10 days, but that would result in massive casualties. ""We're like policemen. We're not fighting a war. If we wanted to fight a war in Afghanistan and win it, I could win it in a week. I just don't want to kill 10 million people. Does that make sense to you? I don't want to kill 10 million people,"" Trump said. The US has instead been pursuing a diplomatic strategy to end the war -- with US-Taliban talks held in Qatar -- while still keeping up military pressure on the Taliban. Trump's comments came as he welcomed Khan to the White House for the first time on Monday with Afghanistan peace talks and Pakistani support for a range of militant groups topping the agenda. Senior administration officials said that Trump would press the Pakistani prime minister to crack down on militants in Pakistan and provide more support for ongoing the US-Taliban peace. But while Trump said Pakistan had previously been ""subversive"" to US efforts to combat the Taliban and other militants in Afghanistan, he suggested that unhelpfulness was in the past. ""I don't think Pakistan respected the United States, I don't think Pakistan respected its presidents,"" Trump said. ""And I don't blame them because they were dealing with the wrong presidents."" Instead, Trump touted Pakistan's role in fomenting progress in the US-Taliban talks in recent weeks and said he believes Pakistan ""is going to help us out to extricate ourselves"" from the war in Afghanistan. Khan, for his part, argued right now is ""the closest we have been to a peace deal"" in Afghanistan. ""We hope that in the coming days we will be able to urge the Taliban to speak with the Afghan government,"" Khan said. US-Pakistan relations have been on rocky footing for years over Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban, hitting a low point last year when Trump suspended US security assistance to Pakistan over what the US saw as Pakistan's failure to clamp down on the Taliban and other militant groups operating out of Pakistan. The US is not at the moment planning to resume its security assistance to Pakistan absent concrete efforts to crack down on the Taliban and Haqqani network, a senior administration official said on Friday, though Trump said Monday the security aid ""can come back depending on what we work out."" ""We will consider changing that suspension on certain items if Pakistan meets our security concerns both in Afghanistan and with regard to some of the externally focused groups,"" the official said on Friday. ""As of now there is no change."" But the invitation for Khan to meet with Trump at the White House is intended to show Pakistan that the ""door is open to repairing relations and building an enduring relationship,"" the official said. The meeting comes as US officials and Taliban leaders continue to hold multiple rounds of talks in Qatar aimed at ending the nearly 18-year US war in Afghanistan. The US has pressed Pakistan to use its leverage over the Taliban to encourage the militant group to reach a peace deal with the US. Khan, a former cricketer who came into power in the summer of 2018, has made anti-corruption a signature issue. An administration official said the US sees some positive initial steps in seizing militant assets, but the US is hoping for more concrete steps going forward. ""Khan is saying the right things, but what we really need to see to prove that this is something different are actual arrests and convictions as well as evictions of those Taliban and Haqqani leaders who don't support peace,"" an official said. Senior administration officials told reporters on Friday that Trump would also raise the imprisonment of Dr. Shakil Afridi, a Pakistani physician who helped the US capture Osama bin Laden in 2011. Afridi, who helped the CIA run a fake hepatitis vaccine program that helped locate bin Laden, was captured in the days following the raid. Pakistan has resisted US calls for his release. Trump said Monday he would raise Afridi's case with Khan. ""They will be judged by how he is treated,"" an official said. Pakistan's increasingly close relationship with China is also expected to be on the agenda when Trump and Khan meet Monday. Since taking office, Khan has already visited Beijing twice and China has made deep investments in Pakistan. US officials said the US would ""ensure that Pakistan understands this lending should be transparent and they should make sure they're not getting over-indebted to China."" That includes warnings about allowing Chinese telecom giant Huawei -- which the US deems a security risk -- to develop a 5G network there. Trump will meet with Khan in the Oval Office on Monday followed by a lunch meeting in the Cabinet Room, according to the White House. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, acting Defense Secretary Richard Spencer, deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman, Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, senior adviser Jared Kushner, and press secretary Stephanie Grisham are all expected to attend.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/politics/donald-trump-imran-khan-pakistan-prime-minister-white-house/index.html","2019-07-22T15:47:00Z","2019-07-22T21:21:58Z","2019-07-23T15:17:30Z","cnn","By Jeremy Diamond and Kevin Liptak, CNN","politics","POLITICS","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190722153639-trump-oval-office-bilat-07222019-story-body.jpg"
"67","Ebola outbreak in Congo is a public health emergency of international concern, WHO says","article","The ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo now constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization announced on Wednesday. ""The risk of Ebola spread in DRC and the region remains very high, and the risk of spread outside the region remains low,"" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, said during a press conference on Wednesday. ""Now is the time for the international community to stand in solidarity with the people of DRC."" WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as ""an extraordinary event"" that constitutes a ""public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease"" and ""to potentially require a coordinated international response."" The WHO International Health Regulations' Emergency Committee for Ebola Viral Disease in Congo convened at the organization's world headquarters in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss whether or not the outbreak constitutes international concern. ""The fight is ongoing for a full year now,"" Robert Steffen, chairman of the committee, said during a press conference on Wednesday. The meeting was the fourth time the committee has convened to review the outbreak. In a deliberation on Friday, it was decided that the outbreak does not constitute a public health emergency of international concern. ""This emergency in Congo has been going on for almost a year and is a very, very serious emergency and has been treated as our highest level of emergency since the beginning -- but the difference that's going on with this committee is, do we need to tell the rest of the world to start taking measures? And if so, what measures are we going to tell them to do?"" Dr. Margaret Harris, WHO's communication lead on the Ebola emergency in DRC, said in a video posted to Twitter ahead of the meeting on Wednesday ""They make their decision as a consensus,"" she said. ""They will also lay down what under that public health emergency of international concern other countries need to do. So they will have recommendations for the affected country -- that's Congo. They will have recommendations for the neighboring countries, those most at risk. They will also have recommendations for the rest of the world."" The committee's consensus and recommendations then get presented to the WHO Director-General, who chooses whether or not to agree and adopt the committee's decisions. Global health emergencies are generally only announced in what the WHO calls ""extraordinary"" circumstances, with this being just the fifth declaration of its kind. With its latest declaration, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade, but rather the organization released recommendations for affected countries, which include to continue strengthening community awareness and screenings, among other actions.  WHO's decision to declare a public health emergency of international concern won't markedly shift the DRC's strategy to combat the deadly outbreak, said the country's Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga. ""There is only one strategy to fight Ebola,"" Kalenga said during a press conference in the city of Goma on Thursday. ""It is a series of actions around every case. We need to identify contacts, vaccinate the contacts, and disinfect and respect the general hygiene rules. These measures allow the epidemic to be contained. What changes is the context."" Funding falls short Committee members were disappointed by delays in funding that have constrained the response, according to WHO, despite the outbreak stretching for nearly a year and the confirmed cases of Ebola steadily expanding. WHO officials on the ground have been disappointed with the amount of funding pledges coming in -- way short of the needs for their response -- for several months. While serious, this outbreak has yet to have the level of global attention that the West African outbreak garnered where more than 11,000 people died. There also hasn't been any significant spread outside of the DRC -- something health officials say has led to a form of donor complacency. That complacency was also compounded by the belief that an experimental vaccine would help stop this outbreak in its tracks in the early weeks of the response, according to several responders from both the UN and NGOs whom CNN spoke to on the ground in June. Some donor fatigue also set in because of the perception that their money wasn't being spent in the most efficient way possible, according to extensive CNN reporting last month. The WHO is formulating its fourth strategic plan to try and stamp out the outbreak -- saying it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. That is why, in part, many public health experts expressly called for the emergency designation months ago -- as a way to refocus attention and to bring in much-needed funds. Still, following Wednesday's announcement, Ghebreyesus wrote in a post on Twitter that ""a public health emergency of international concern is not for fundraising, it's for preventing the spread of disease."" The World Health Organization ""is not aware of any donor that has withheld funding because the emergency had not been declared. But if that was the excuse, it can no longer be used."" The humanitarian group Mercy Corps hopes that WHO's declaration ""will translate into urgent and practical action, including more funding from international donors,"" Laura Miller, Mercy Corps' acting country director for DRC, said in a written statement following WHO's announcement. ""Every day, women, men and children are dying of the Ebola virus and it is becoming too easy to forget that the ever-climbing case numbers are people,"" she said in part. ""With the WHO declaration comes the possibility that neighboring countries could react by heavily blocking or reducing border access in a way that restricts trade. This would be devastating for the economy of the region and impact the food security of large numbers of people."" More than 1,600 dead This Ebola outbreak began last summer. On the first day of August in 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the country's North Kivu province. Now the World Health Organization reports a total of 2,512 Ebola cases and 1,676 deaths involved in the outbreak, as of Monday. On Monday, the United Nations hosted a high-level meeting to discuss response efforts amid the current outbreak in Congo. The meeting was held after the first case of Ebola was confirmed on Sunday in the city of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and a major transit hub where some 1 million people reside on the Rwandan border. That case raised fears that the virus could make its way across the porous border into still-uninfected Rwanda -- something health experts have been working desperately to prevent. Health officials and aid organizations have dreaded Ebola's arrival in Goma for months, and have been working to prepare for the eventuality -- which is partly why the case was immediately caught and isolated. These preparation measures include an emergency response team that has carried out outbreak simulation exercises, WHO teams that screen travelers at every entry and exit point in Goma, and workers who check the city's health centers every morning for suspected cases, according to WHO officials. DRC Health Minister Kalenga said on Thursday that the recent confirmed Ebola case of a person traveling to Goma was a pastor, as were other recent cases. So, he said, the practice of placing hands on people during religious ceremonies was a driver of the disease spread. He called on pastors to be responsible and stop this practice. It has been difficult to get ahead of the outbreak as ongoing violence in the area has impacted response efforts. Since January, there have been 198 attacks against health care personnel and patients in Ebola-affected areas, resulting in seven deaths and 58 injuries, according to WHO. The Congolese Ministry of Health released a statement on its official Twitter account on Wednesday accepting the World Health Organization designation that the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo now ""constitutes a public health emergency of international concern."" The statement cited that the number one difficulty in containing the outbreak is a result of ""development issues"" in the region and the ""weak health system."" The ministry added that ""the government is looking into measures"" to prevent people considered high risk ""from spreading the epidemic in the region."" The rare but deadly Ebola virus disease can cause fever, headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding, among other symptoms. The virus was first identified in 1976 when outbreaks occurred near the Ebola River in the DRC. Scientists think the virus initially infected humans through close contact with an infected animal, such as a bat, and then the virus spread from person to person. The virus spreads between humans through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, including infected blood, feces or vomit, or direct contact with contaminated objects, such as needles and syringes. Yet hope comes in the form of research advancements. Experimental treatments and vaccines have been used in Congo. To date, at least 585 patients have recovered from the illness, and more than 133,000 vaccines have been administered, which many believe has helped limit the spread of the outbreak. The rVSV-ZEBOV experimental vaccine, manufactured by Merck, was approved by Congo's health ministry ethics committee for use in country in May 2018. In its previous meeting on Friday, the emergency committee recommended all at-risk countries put in place the necessary approvals for using investigational medicines and vaccines as part of their preparedness.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/health/ebola-outbreak-who-emergency-africa-bn/index.html","2019-07-17T17:47:35Z","2019-07-18T15:27:25Z","2019-07-18T15:27:25Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard and David McKenzie, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190620185536-congo-ebola-outbreak-david-mckenzie-pkg-story-body.jpg"
"68","Mosquitoes have been almost completely wiped out on two Chinese islands","article","A population of the world's most invasive mosquito species was almost completely wiped out by an experiment on two islands in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, according to a study published Wednesday. The experiment successfully reduced the female Asian Tiger Mosquito population -- the main source of bites and disease transmission -- by up to 94%, reducing the number of reported human bites by 97%.  It isn't the first attempt by researchers to reduce mosquito populations across the world. In 2018, scientists from the Imperial College of London used gene-editing tools to render female mosquitoes sterile, while males developed normally and continued spreading the genetic mutation.  One of the Chinese study's researchers, Xi Zhiyong, a professor at Michigan State University, has been a longtime pioneer in this field of study. Running a mosquito factory in southern China, he previously attempted to use sterilized male mosquitoes to mate with unaltered females. ""We're building good mosquitoes that can help us fight the bad ones"", Xi told CNN in 2016. In the new study, published by the International Journal of Science, Xi and his colleagues attempted to cut mosquito numbers even further by limiting both male and females' ability to reproduce. Female mosquitoes were sterilized with low level radiation while the males were infected with the Wolbachia bacteria, then both were released during the peak breeding seasons in 2016 and 2017 on two islands near Guangzhou city. The results were so successful they nearly eradicated the entire female mosquito population on the two islands. In a statement, mosquito ecologist Peter Armbruster said the trial was one of the most successful mosquito reduction trials to date given mosquitoes' stubborn survivability.  Experts said the Asian tiger mosquitoes are particularly hard to eradicate using conventional population control methods, such as pesticides and removing stagnant water where the insects lay their eggs. The white-striped mosquitoes have been described as ""highly invasive"" and have spread from Asia to almost every continent over the past 40 years, according to the study's authors.   Mosquitoes pose grave threats to human health beyond just irritating bites. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the insects as ""one of the deadliest animals in the world,"" due to their ability to rapidly spread deadly diseases such as dengue fever and malaria. Guangzhou, a densely populated urban metropolis with a tropical climate, saw around 37,350 people infected with dengue fever during an outbreak in 2014. This month, Philippines health authorities declared a ""national dengue alert"" after more than 450 people were killed by the virus in just the first half of 2019. There is currently no effective vaccine or treatment for most mosquio-transmitted diseases, leaving controlling the insects' populations one of the most effective control methods, according to the International Journal of Science.  ""A new tool like what's being described in this paper is very much needed,"" Dobson said.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/18/health/asian-tiger-mosquitoes-guangzhou-intl-hnk/index.html","2019-07-18T08:16:03Z","2019-07-18T08:16:03Z","2019-07-18T08:16:03Z","cnn","By Ella Hurworth, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190703154007-01-west-nile-mosquito-story-body.jpg"
"69","German government backs mandatory vaccinations for all schoolchildren","article","Parents in Germany who fail to vaccinate their children could face hefty fines after the German government backed a bill requiring all children to receive a measles jab before entering school or kindergarten. If the German parliament approves the bill, parents will be required to provide evidence that their child has been vaccinated before they are enrolled, and will face fines of up to €2,500 ($2,800) if they fail to do so. ""Whether in kindergarten, at the childminder or at school -- we want to protect all children against measles infection,"" Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a statement. The move comes as Germany reported one of the highest numbers of measles cases in Europe between March 2018 and February this year, at 651, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In 2019, 429 cases were registered in Germany by mid-June, the Health Ministry said, suggesting the problem is escalating.  Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also spread if someone comes into direct contact or shares germs by touching the same objects or surfaces. Measles symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots. It takes two doses of the vaccine to protect from measles. While 97% of German children had their first dose, the percentage that received the second dose dropped to 93%, the World Health Organization said for 2017. Experts say about 95% of people must be vaccinated to make communities immune. Measles has seen a wider resurgence around the world -- in high-income countries in the Americas and Europe and lower-income nations in Asia and Africa --  fueled in part by fear of and lack of access to vaccines, and complacency. And while numerous studies have debunked claims that measles vaccinations cause autism, widespread fear persists. Under the policy, parents would have to present a certificate proving their child has received both vaccinations. Unvaccinated children will be excluded from kindergartens, the ministry said. WHO has deemed vaccine hesitancy -- the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines -- a top 10 threat to global health in 2019. Among high-income countries, the United States topped the list of children not vaccinated with the first dose, according to WHO. There have been 1,123 there as of Friday, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the greatest number reported in the United States since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000, meaning it was no longer continuously transmitted in the country.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/health/germany-measles-mandatory-vaccine-scli-intl/index.html","2019-07-17T13:46:58Z","2019-07-17T13:46:58Z","2019-07-17T13:46:58Z","cnn","By Rob Picheta, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190715162415-cnnee-measles-story-body.jpg"
"70","Experimental Ebola treatments effective in lab study","article","Two experimental Ebola drugs have been found to be effective in treating the strain of the deadly virus responsible for the deaths of more than 1,600 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to new research published Tuesday. Laura McMullan, a microbiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who lead the research, said the two treatments were developed based on strains from previous outbreaks and this study was the first to test them on the current one, which researchers are calling the Ituri strain. ""It's vitally important to make sure existing treatments work against the virus that's making people sick now,"" she said. An antiviral drug called remdesivir and another antibody treatment called ZMapp both inhibited the growth of the virus strain in human cells in laboratory studies, according to the paper published in the medical journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. ""They're currently being tested in a clinical trial but we needed to verify and make sure that they were going to be as effective,"" she told CNN.  ""Information that we knew about how well they worked was based on a different Ebola virus variant so we needed to make sure that, indeed, these compounds were going to bind and block the virus and measure that, and see if it worked as well in order for the clinical trials to proceed,"" she said.  According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization, the Ebola outbreak in Congo has killed 1,630 people, with 2,418 total cases of the deadly disease. It's the second biggest outbreak of the disease in history; the largest recorded was in West Africa from that killed more 11,000 people starting in 2014. Experimental treatments ZMapp and remdesivir are among four promising experimental treatments that have been used in the Congo under what's called a compassionate use framework, with doctors deciding the best treatment for each patient based, in part, on the complexity of administering and monitoring the drug, according to WHO. In 2014, ZMapp became known when it was used to treat two American missionary workers, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who contracted Ebola in Liberia. Prior to that, the experimental drug had been tested only in monkeys. However, a 2016 study that looked at 72 people who had had Ebola found that Zmapp might not have been a key factor in their survival.  It found that although it was beneficial overall, ZMapp ""did not meet the prespecified statistical threshold for efficacy."" ""This work has benefits beyond the current study,"" said Inger Damon, chief strategy officer for the CDC's 2018 Ebola response and director of CDC's Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. ""Having access to this virus will allow us to explore whether other compounds or potential therapies affect the virus in the lab."" Health authorities have also made successful use of an experimental vaccine that has been found to be 97% effective in the Congo Ebola outbreak. Because the treatments are experimental, meaning they are still being studied, they are administered with strict protocols and require informed consent. Despite the new drugs to fight the disease, Ebola is spreading to new parts of eastern Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces and re-infecting areas thought rid of the virus. Last month, it also made the long-feared jump across the border to neighboring Uganda, though those isolated cases appear to have been contained. Deep mistrust of authorities, attacks on health care workers and simmering conflict in the region has meant that the outbreak has continued unabated 11 months after the first cases were confirmed.  In its latest update on July 4, WHO said that over the past four weeks a ""general deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity"" had led to delays and temporary suspensions in investigating suspected cases.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/health/ebola-drc-experimental-treatments-intl/index.html","2019-07-09T22:30:35Z","2019-07-09T22:30:35Z","2019-07-09T22:30:35Z","cnn","By Katie Hunt, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190620185536-congo-ebola-outbreak-david-mckenzie-pkg-story-body.jpg"
"71","British boys will receive HPV vaccine to prevent 'thousands of cancers'","article","Boys aged 12 and 13 will be offered the HPV vaccine in all British schools from September, in a move health officials say will prevent thousands of cancer cases.  The jab would protect against a range of cancers caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) including throat, penile and anal strains of the disease. The National Health Service (NHS) will offer the vaccine free to boys in Year Eight of secondary schools across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland -- 11 years after the measure was introduced for girls. In total, the HPV vaccine program could prevent over 100,000 cases of cancer by 2058, officials said.HPV is a group of 150 related viruses that can be transmitted through any form of sexual contact, whether kissing or intercourse.  In most cases, the human body will get rid of it naturally, but certain high-risk types can develop into things like genital warts and cancers. About 5% of all cancers worldwide are linked to the HPV virus, including cervical cancer and some affecting the head and neck. In the United States, high-risk HPV infections cause about 3% of all cancers in women and 2% in men, according to the National Cancer Institute.  To date 10 million doses of HPV vaccine have been given to young women in Britain, meaning that more than eight out of ten women aged 15 to 24 have been vaccinated. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""almost every person who is sexually active will get HPV at some time in their life if they don't get the HPV vaccine."" The vaccine is a mimic of the virus particle, but when administered into someone's muscle, it creates many more antibodies than a natural infection would, according to John Doorbar, professor of viral pathogenesis at the University of Cambridge. Public Health England found that since the jab was introduced infections of some types of HPV (HPV 16/18) in 16 to 21 year old women have reduced by 86 per cent in England. A Scottish study also showed that the vaccine has reduced pre-cancerous cervical disease in women by up to 71 per cent.  Besides protecting boys, the new development will also help reduce the overall number of cervical cancers in women, through a process known as ""herd immunity.""  The government body cited research by the University of Warwick which estimated that, as a whole, the HPV vaccine programme could prevent up to 64,138 cervical cancers and 49,649 other cancers by 2058 - 50 years after it was first introduced for girls. That would include some 30,000 cancer cases in males. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England (PHE), encouraged parents of all eligible children to ""take up the offer for this potentially life-saving vaccine"" without delay.  In a statement, she added: ""This universal programme offers us the opportunity to make HPV-related diseases a thing of the past and build on the success of the girls' programme. ""Offering the vaccine to boys will not only protect them but will also prevent more cases of HPV-related cancers in girls and reduce the overall burden of these cancers in both men and women in the future."" It is important not to delay the vaccine as it can become less effective as adolescents grow older, according to Dr Ramsay. A second dose is administered between six and 24 months after the initial jab.  Extensive research of the vaccine by leading health bodies worldwide shows that it offers protection for at least a decade, although experts say it could last for much longer and may even be lifelong, according to Public Health England.  The USA is one of the few other countries to offer the vaccine to boys. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP, voted unanimously to recommend HPV vaccines for both boys and girls and men and women until age 26. Previously it recommended that teen girls and young women who had not been adequately vaccinated receive the vaccine up to 26, but the recommendation for teen boys and young men only went up to 21.  Prof Arne Akbar, president of the British Society for Immunology, said in reaction to the news: ""The extension of the HPV vaccine to boys will build on the proven success of the girls' program to protect boys from human papilloma virus infections that can cause a variety of cancers including those of the anus, mouth and throat.   ""The government now needs to work with the NHS and local authorities to ensure that we maintain efforts to actively communicate the important health benefits of this vaccine to parents and adolescents.  We encourage parents of eligible boys and girls to take up the offer and protect future generations against these preventable diseases with the HPV vaccine.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/health/hpv-vaccine-boys-scli-gbr-intl/index.html","2019-07-09T15:12:33Z","2019-07-09T15:41:43Z","2019-07-09T15:41:43Z","cnn","Lianne Kolirin","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190204183938-vph-virus-papiloma-humano-eliminacion-cura-ipn-investigadora-ciencia-cancer-cervicouterino-eva-ramon-vo-perspectivas-mexico-00001702-story-body.jpg"
"72","Fewer measles cases reported last week, but it's not time to declare victory","article","The number of measles cases reported in the United States has fallen the last few weeks, but experts say it's not time to declare victory. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Monday that the number of measles cases this year reached 1,109 across 28 states as of Thursday. That's an increase of 14 cases from the previous week. While it's a smaller number of new cases than was typical in the spring, this year's outbreak hit the greatest number of measles cases reported in the United States since 1992 and since the measles virus was eliminated from the country in the year 2000. ""We're in a new normal now,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. ""We haven't seen measles epidemics in the United States for over 20 years."" While specific factors contributing to what appears to be a regression in new measles cases remains somewhat unclear, Hotez said that there are a few factors that could be at play. ""Measles historically is seasonal. We know it peaks in the spring and then declines in the summer. So there is a seasonality to the virus, just like there's a seasonality to influenza,"" Hotez said, adding that another factor is that children are currently out of school. ""A couple of questions that I'm looking at is: One, what happens when kids come back to school in the fall? Because although measles cases have declined, they haven't disappeared,"" he said. ""I am concerned that we're going to see the uptick again as we move into the fall months -- and then the other question: What happens in 2020? Will we see a big jump in the spring of 2020? In other words, is this peak in the spring of 2019 just the beginning of frequent peaks?"" As the measles outbreak grew earlier this year, attention turned to anti-vaccination messages online, prompting some social media platforms to suppress certain content that was deemed as spreading misinformation about vaccines. For instance, Facebook has changed its ranking system to show fewer posts with misleading health claims. YouTube has removed ads from videos it considers as spreading misinformation. And Amazon has pulled anti-vaccination documentaries from its Amazon Prime Video streaming service. Hotez said, however, that those actions were not enough and efforts so far from social media and e-commerce groups have been ""mostly cosmetic."" Many social media platforms have not actively taken down content containing misinformation about vaccines, he said. ""Nothing much has really changed,"" Hotez said. ""I would say any decline in measles has happened without the help of social media and e-commerce."" When the number of measles cases surpassed 1,000 in the United States last month, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement that his department was working to stop the spread of misinformation about vaccines. ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, alongside others across HHS, will continue our efforts to support local health departments and healthcare providers in responding to this situation, with the ultimate goal of stopping the outbreak and the spread of misinformation about vaccines, and increasing the public's confidence in vaccines to help all Americans live healthier lives, safe from vaccine-preventable diseases,"" he said in the statement. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in existence, spreading through coughing and sneezing. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person coughs or sneezes. If someone who is not immune to the virus breathes that air or touches an infected surface, they can become infected. To protect yourself against the measles, doctors recommend getting vaccinated. Other steps include washing your hands often or using hand sanitizer, avoiding touching your eyes and mouth, disinfecting surfaces and toys with standard household products, and refraining from coming into close contact with anyone who's sick.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/health/measles-outbreak-new-normal/index.html","2019-07-08T19:27:43Z","2019-07-08T19:27:43Z","2019-07-08T19:27:43Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502192608-measles-story-body.jpg"
"73","9 challenges Amazon faces on its 25th birthday","article","As Amazon marks its 25th year, the groundbreaking company is dealing with a host of controversy and problems. High-powered officials are challenging its size and calling for it to be broken up. Politicians are raising questions about its worker pay. And Amazon faces growing competition from rivals. The Seattle-based company, whose dominance now reaches around the world, could be facing a quarter-life crisis. Elizabeth Warren calls for a breakup  Senator Elizabeth Warren doesn't like what she sees in Big Tech. The Democratic presidential candidate released a plan to break up giant companies like Amazon. She wants to impose new rules on certain kinds of tech companies that have $25 billion or more in annual revenue, and unwind some high-profile mergers such as Amazon's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods. ""Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,"" Warren wrote in a Medium blog post published in March. AOC slams Jeff Bezos' pay Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has slammed Amazon CEO Bezos for being a billionaire while his company pays its warehouse workers what she called ""starvation wages.""  She recently said in an interview with ABC News that the company's low worker pay has helped make Bezos the world's richest person.  In a response to the New York Democrat, Amazon said she is ""just wrong."" The company says it pays a $15 minimum wage and offers full benefits to employees in their first days on the job. It also noted that it has lobbied to raise the federal minimum wage. Senator Bernie Sanders has also made similar arguments against Amazon's worker pay.   Biden questions Amazon's taxes Joe Biden knocked Amazon over the amount of corporate taxes it pays.  ""I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth,"" he said on Twitter. The tweet from the former vice president and Democratic presidential hopeful referenced a corporate tax rebate that Amazon received in 2018. Amazon responded, saying in a tweet that the company pays ""every penny we owe."" It added: ""Congress designed tax laws to encourage companies to reinvest in the American economy. We have $200B in investments since 2011 & 300K US jobs. Assume VP Biden's complaint is w/ the tax code, not Amazon."" Trump investigates post office deal Amazon isn't getting much reprieve from the Trump administration, thanks to the president's beef with Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos as well as the United States Postal Service. Last year, Trump ordered a federal task force to investigate the Postal Service's finances because he thinks Amazon takes advantage of the agency. At the root of all this drama is likely Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post, which has published stories that are unfavorable of to Trump throughout his presidency. Amazon has a confidential agreement with the Postal Service under which the agency delivers a large number of packages directly to the post office closest to their destination. The Postal Service then delivers the packages to customers. Employees want to fix climate change Amazon employees are putting pressure on the company to rethink how it contributes to the battle against global warming. In April, a group of 3,500 employees signed a Medium post that urged Bezos to publicly outline the company's plans to reduce carbon emissions and its reliance on fossil fuels. The signatories said that Amazon's ""sustainability goals lack context."" Amazon unveiled in February a project it called Shipment Zero, which makes all packages net zero carbon and 50% of all shipments net zero by 2030. The company said it has 200 scientists, engineers, and product designers focused on sustainability efforts, from solar and wind farms to efforts around shipment waste. Angering its hometown headquarters Amazon publicly opposed a proposed a new ""head tax"" that the city of Seattle wanted to place on large businesses to address homelessness and fund affordable housing. Companies would pay 26 cents per working hour for each employee it has in Seattle, or roughly $540 a year for every full-time employee. The tax would've hit Amazon hard, since it's the city's largest private employer. It has more than 45,000 employees in the Washington city, so it would've paid more than $20 million a year. In response, Amazon temporarily halted construction of a new 17-floor tower.  The bill was scuttled and Seattle ended up passing a smaller version of the tax. Problems with its HQ2 Amazon had to retreat from Long Island City in New York after it announced in February that it planned to build a second headquarters there. That news prompted lots of public outcry from both the public and local officials. Amazon ditched its plans three months later, saying ""a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence."" Critics blasted the $1.525 billion in incentives New York offered to lure the tech behemoth and worried that it would soon lead to longtime residents being priced out of their homes. Amazon ditches China Amazon also pulled back from the world's biggest market for online shopping, China. It closed its marketplace, meaning Amazon customers in the country will no longer be able to buy goods from Chinese merchants. Amazon first entered the Chinese market 15 years ago, when it acquired an online book retailer, but it has struggled amid fierce competition. Research suggests that the company's market share in China was miniscule compared to local rivals, like Alibaba. Stamping out anti-vaxxers A CNN Business investigation in February revealed that Amazon was offering lots of anti-vaccination content to people seeking information about the controversial topic. When asked about it, Amazon said it provides customers with ""access to a variety of viewpoints, including books that some customers may find objectionable.""  Anti-vax material was also available on its Prime Video service. Days after the investigation published, Amazon began removing the anti-vaccine videos. But some books on the topic are still being sold despite the dangerous and unproven nature of the theory.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/business/amazon-25th-birthday-challenges-trnd/index.html","2019-07-04T12:28:37Z","2019-07-05T12:28:25Z","2019-07-05T12:28:25Z","cnn","By Jordan Valinsky, CNN Business","business","BUSINESS","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181012115857-amazon-government-story-body.jpg"
"74","Autism Fast Facts","article","Here is a look at autism. Autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) incorporates a group of neurodevelopmental disorders causing impaired communication skills and social skills. ASD generally starts before three years of age and lasts a lifetime, but early intervention plays a role in treatment and progress. ASD is about four times more common among boys than girls, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ASD can be found among all races, ethnicities and socioeconomic groups. The prevalence of ASD in the United States is about one in 59 children, according to a 2018 CDC report. Health care costs for children with autism are four to six times greater than medical costs for children without autism, according to research published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. April 2 is World Autism Day. Diagnosis:
There is no definitive medical test to diagnose autism. Instead, the disorder is diagnosed by observing a child's development. According to the CDC, signs of autism may include deficits in social communication and interaction in a variety of contexts, difficulty engaging in back-and-forth conversation and an absence of interest in forming friendships with peers. Vaccines and Autism:
The debate over whether autism spectrum disorders are caused by vaccines started in 1998 when the medical journal The Lancet published a now-retracted study by researcher Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine to autism. Most of Wakefield's co-authors withdrew their names from the study when they learned he had been compensated by a law firm intending to sue manufacturers of the vaccine in question. In 2010, Wakefield lost his medical license. In 2011, the Lancet retracted the study after an investigation found Wakefield altered or misrepresented information on the 12 children who were the basis for the conclusion of the study. Other researchers have not been able to replicate Wakefield's findings. Several subsequent studies trying to reproduce the results have found no link between vaccines and autism, including several reviews by the Institute of Medicine. Timeline:
Early 1900s - Autistic characteristics are studied as symptoms of schizophrenia. 1938 - Donald Gray Triplett of Mississippi is first examined by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner of Johns Hopkins Hospital and later becomes the first person diagnosed with autism symptoms. 1943 - Triplett is identified as ""Donald T."" in the paper ""Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact"" by Kanner. The paper elaborates on the idea that autism is related to lack of parental warmth; this is later dubbed the ""refrigerator mother"" theory. 1944 - Hans Asperger, an Austrian physician, publishes a paper about autistic syndrome. The paper gains wider recognition when it is translated into English in the early 1990s. 1964 - Bernard Rimland, a research psychologist, publishes ""Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior,"" which contradicts the ""refrigerator mother"" hypothesis. Kanner is the author of the foreword. 1965 - Rimland founds the National Society for Autistic Children (now the Autism Society of America). He later establishes the Autism Research Institute. 1980 - Autism is classified separately from schizophrenia in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). December 18, 2007 - The United Nations adopts a resolution declaring April 2 World Autism Awareness Day. October 29, 2014 - The medical journal Nature reports that scientists have identified 60 genes with a greater than 90% chance of increasing a child's autism risk. December 17, 2015 - Scientists at Harvard and MIT announce they have found, for the first time, a link between autistic behavior and reduced activity of a key neurotransmitter, a type of brain chemical that enables the transmission of signals across neurons, allowing the brain to communicate with other organs. April 21, 2016 - The Simons Foundation announces that it is launching an autism research project called SPARK. The study, which involves scientists at 21 hospitals and university clinics, will focus on the possible connection between genetics and autism. Parents of children with autism are invited to sign up online and participate in the study. The group also works with Autism Speaks and the Autism Science Foundation to run the Autism BrainNet network, which is an autism brain bank that collects postmortem donations. February 2017 - Researchers find that monitoring MRI brain scans of infants may help predict whether they will develop autism, according to a study published in the journal, Nature. The researchers found a possible link between brain enlargement during the first year of life and an autism diagnosis at age 2. This builds on previous similar research. March 19, 2017 - CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" profiles ""Sesame Street's"" newest Muppet character, a girl named Julia who has autism. April 11, 2017 - A study published in the American Journal of Public Health finds that people with autism are three times more likely than the general population to die because of preventable injuries, and children and young teens with autism are 40 times more likely to die from preventable injury than the general child population. Suffocation, asphyxiation and drowning are the leading causes of fatal injuries among people with autism. March 26, 2018 - According to a study published in JAMA Pediatrics, children with autism spectrum disorder and their younger siblings are less likely to be fully vaccinated than children unaffected by autism. March 4, 2019 - A study of over 650,000 children published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine shows that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine does not increase the risk of autism and does not trigger autism in children who are at risk. April 29, 2019 - A study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children can be screened for autism spectrum disorder at 14 months of age with high accuracy (instead of 18 to 24 months of age, as is currently recommended).","https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/14/health/autism-fast-facts/index.html","2013-10-14T19:44:38Z","2019-07-04T21:53:03Z","2019-07-04T21:53:03Z","cnn","CNN Library","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120123105109-martin-autism-kids-story-body.jpg"
"75","Researchers have created a 'vaccine' for fake news. It's a game","article","There isn't a cure for fake news. But as with any disease, prevention is often the best medicine. Researchers at Cambridge University claim they have created a ""vaccine"" for fake news and misinformation that takes the form of a video game.  The project has already drawn the attention of Google, which has been criticized for allowing conspiratorial content to spread on its YouTube platform, and WhatsApp, where fake news is sometimes forwarded in group chats. The online game puts users in the place of a fake news creator, allowing them to make misleading or fake Tweets, websites and memes as they gain virtual followers and credibility.  The game's creators, Jon Roozenbeek and Sander van der Linden, said their new study shows that when people learn how to create fake news in the game, they are better able to resist it in real life. ""Just as misinformation spreads like a virus we thought the potential vaccine could be ... a vehicle that people could share and learn something from,"" van der Linden told CNN Business in an interview.  Van der Linden has been studying fake news and misinformation for years. He and Roozenbeek started by testing individual participants in a lab, educating them about common myths or stereotypes. But they realized the approach was time consuming and topic specific, so they started thinking of ways to teach people the skills they would need to be able to spot misinformation in social media, no matter the topic. Using psychological approaches to how people best learn, they created the ""Bad News"" game, which is available at www.getbadnews.com.  It takes about 15 minutes to play, with players earning six badges that reflect misinformation strategies: impersonation, provocative emotional content, polarization, conspiracy theories, discrediting opponents and trolling.  ""When you go to a magic show you may be duped by the trick because you don't know how it works,"" van der Linden said. ""But once you know how it works you won't be fooled again."" Working with a sample of 15,000 game participants, van der Linden and Roozenbeek said they found evidence that people's ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after playing.  The researchers are open about the limitations of their results, saying that their sample group skewed toward males with some higher education.  The study was published last week in the peer-reviewed journal Palgrave Communications.  Van der Linden said that Google, WhatsApp, the British Foreign Office and the European Commission are all working with them on how to use the game.  WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, helped fund research into the game. A company spokesperson said the goal is to understand ""what steps can be taken both within WhatsApp and through our support to civil society to help address this problem."" Van der Linden said a special version of the game is being developed for WhatsApp, which has been linked to the spread misinformation in countries like India that contributed to violence. Google's research arm Jigsaw has also approached the researchers about creating a game that appeals to the elderly, van der Linden said. While there's not yet a formal partnership, a Google spokesperson said the discussions are part of their overall approach to help ""us share knowledge and test the usability of technology.""  The game has also been modified for different languages and aims. In the Middle East, van der Linden said they're testing using the game to combat radicalization. Van der Linden said he's not concerned that a game that teaches people how to create fake news could be misused. Interested parties would learn how to create misinformation regardless, he argued. ""Our hope is that enough people get vaccinated in this way that it offers enough herd immunity that even if some people go rogue, the people are protected by the larger community,"" he said.

"76","Beijing admits 'weaknesses' in handling of African swine fever crisis","article","The Chinese government issued a rare admission of failure Wednesday, saying that there had been ""weaknesses"" in the handling of an African swine fever epidemic which has now spread to all of China's 25 provinces. In a statement released by the State Council, the government said there had been problems in a wide-range of areas as the country attempted to battle the fast-spreading and currently incurable disease. ""There are many weaknesses in the live pig management inspection chain ... Live hog transportation isn't strict enough, there is insufficient capacity to test for African swine fever in slaughterhouses, basic animal quarantine isn't comprehensive and the ability to prevent epidemics is weak,"" the report said. ""The situation is still complicated and severe."" China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in June that the country's pig stocks were down by a quarter compared to a year ago, while the stocks of breeding sows were down 23.9% year-on-year compared to May 2018. At a press briefing Thursday, Yu Kangzhen, China's vice minister of agriculture and rural affairs claimed the outbreaks of African swine fever had ""slowed,"" and said progress was being made on a vaccine. ""Although we have a good start and have made progress in vaccine research, there may be many uncertainties at the later stage of the research,"" he said. ""China attaches high importance to the research for the vaccine."" The Chinese government said on Thursday that in total 1.16 million pigs had been culled as a result of the epidemic, but research by Rabobank suggested that up to 200 million animals could be affected. The Dutch bank suggested that losses to China's pig stocks could eventually be as high as 70%. ""China's pork consumption has dropped by 10% to 15%, year-to-date, by our estimates, driven by food safety concerns,"" the bank said in a June report. According to official Chinese government statistics, as of April there were 375 million pigs in China. Pork farmers across the country have been devastated by the disease, which is fatal to pigs but has no noticeable affect on humans as yet.  ""It began with a few pigs a day, then it was hundreds,"" Sun Dawu, a pig farmer and agricultural entrepreneur from Hebei province, China said in May. ""In the end, 800 pigs would die in a single day."" Some farms have been entirely wiped out by the disease, losing as many as 20,000 pigs to the fever or to the culling. Pork is a huge part of the Chinese diet and prices have risen as a result of the epidemic. Since being first detected in China in August 2018, swine fever has spread to other countries in the Asia region.  Outbreaks have been detected in Mongolia, Vietnam and Cambodia, and more than two million pigs have been culled as a result.

"77","Zika Virus Infection Fast Facts","article","Here's a look at the Zika virus disease, an illness spread through mosquito bites that can cause birth defects and other neurological defects.  Facts:
Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO) and CNN The Zika virus is a flavivirus, part of the same family as yellow fever, West Nile, chikungunya and dengue fever. But unlike some of those viruses, there is no vaccine to prevent Zika or a specific medicine to treat the infection. Zika is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. It becomes infected from biting an infected human and then transmits the virus to another person. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is an aggressive species, active day and night and usually bites when it is light out, in the early morning or late afternoon. The virus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sexual contact, blood transfusion or by needle. Zika virus outbreaks occurred in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands prior to 2015. As of March 2018, CDC estimated there were at least 90 countries and territories with active Zika virus transmissions.  CDC is studying the link between Zika and Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that can lead to life-threatening paralysis. It is known to be a side effect associated with other viral illnesses such as influenza. In February 2016, WHO reported, ""Although at least 15 groups are working on Zika vaccines, WHO estimates that it will be at least 18 months before vaccines could be tested in large-scale trials."" The FDA approved the first human trial of a Zika vaccine in June 2016. As of 2019, there is still no available vaccine or medication.  Cases including confirmed, probable or suspected cases of Zika in US states and territories updated weekly by CDC. Symptoms:
Most people infected with Zika virus won't have symptoms. If there are symptoms, they typically appear a few days to a week after exposure, although the precise incubation period is not known. Fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis (red eyes) are the most common symptoms of Zika virus. Some patients may also experience muscle pain or headaches. Zika and Pregnancy:
Zika is commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly, a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. Microcephaly can cause severe developmental issues and sometimes death. A Zika infection may cause other birth defects, including eye problems, hearing loss and impaired growth. Miscarriage can also occur. During an April 2016 press briefing, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said, ""It is now clear the CDC has concluded that Zika does cause microcephaly. This confirmation is based on a thorough review of the best scientific evidence conducted by CDC and other experts in maternal and fetal health and mosquito-borne diseases."" An August 2018 report published by the CDC estimates that nearly one in seven babies born to women infected with the Zika virus while pregnant had one or more health problems possibly caused by the virus, including microcephaly.     According to CDC, there is no evidence that previous infection will affect future pregnancies. Timeline:
(Sources: WHO, CDC and CNN) 1947 - The Zika virus is first discovered in a monkey by scientists studying yellow fever in Uganda's Zika forest. 1948 - The virus is isolated from Aedes africanus mosquito samples in the Zika forest. 1964 - First active case of Zika virus found in humans. While researchers had found antibodies in the blood of people in both Uganda and in Tanzania as far back as 1952, this is the first known case of the active virus in humans. The infected man developed a pinkish rash over most of his body but reported the illness as ""mild,"" with none of the pain associated with dengue and chikungunya. 1960s-1980s - A small number of countries in West Africa and Asia find Zika in mosquitoes, and isolated, rare cases are reported in humans. April-July 2007 - The first major outbreak in humans occurs on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia. Of the suspected 185 cases reported, 49 are confirmed, and 59 are considered probable. There are an additional 77 suspected cases. No deaths are reported. 2008 - Two American researchers studying in Senegal become ill with the Zika virus after returning to the United States. Subsequently, one of the researchers transmits the virus to his wife. This is now believed to be the first known sexual transmission of the Zika virus.  2013-2014 - A large outbreak of Zika occurs in French Polynesia, with about 32,000 suspected cases. There are also outbreaks in the Pacific Islands, including Easter Island, the Cook Islands, and New Caledonia during that time. An uptick in cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome during the same period suggests a possible link between the Zika virus and the rare neurological syndrome. However, it was not proven because the islands were also experiencing an outbreak of dengue fever at the time. March 2015 - Brazil alerts WHO to an illness with skin rash that is present in the northeastern region of the country. From February 2015 to April 29, 2015, nearly 7,000 cases of illness with a skin rash are reported in that area of Brazil. Zika is not the suspected illness at the time. Later in the month, Brazil provides additional information to WHO on the illnesses. April 29, 2015 - A state laboratory in Brazil informs WHO that preliminary samples have tested positive for the Zika virus.  May 7, 2015 - The outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil prompts WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to issue an epidemiological alert. October 30, 2015 - Brazil reports an increase in the cases of microcephaly, babies born with abnormally small heads: 54 cases between August and October 30. November 11, 2015 - Brazil declares a national public health emergency as the number of newborns with microcephaly continues to rise. November 27, 2015 - Brazil reports it is examining 739 cases of microcephaly. November 28, 2015 - Brazil reports three deaths from Zika infection: two adults and one newborn. January 15 & 22, 2016 - CDC advises all pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant to postpone travel or consult their physicians prior to traveling to any of the countries where Zika is active.  February 2016 - CDC reports Zika virus in brain tissue samples from two Brazilian babies who died within a day of birth, as well as in fetal tissue from two miscarriages providing the first proof of a potential connection between Zika and the rising number of birth defects, stillbirths and miscarriages in mothers infected with the virus. February 1, 2016 - WHO declares Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the increase of neurological disorders, such as microcephaly, in areas of French Polynesia and Brazil. February 8, 2016 - CDC elevates its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for Zika to Level 1, the highest level of response at CDC.  February 26, 2016 - Amid indications that the mosquito-borne Zika virus is causing microcephaly in newborns, CDC advises pregnant women to ""consider not going"" to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. CDC later strengthens the advisory, telling pregnant women, ""Do not go to the Olympics."" March 4, 2016 - The US Olympic Committee announces the formation of an infectious disease advisory group to help the USOC establish ""best practices regarding the mitigation, assessment and management of infectious disease, paying particular attention to how issues may affect athletes and staff participating in the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games."" May 27, 2016 - More than 100 prominent doctors and scientists sign an open letter to WHO Director General Margaret Chan, calling for the summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro to be postponed or moved ""in the name of public health"" due to the widening Zika outbreak in Brazil. July 8, 2016 - Health officials in Utah report the first Zika-related death in the continental United States. August 1, 2016 - Pregnant women and their partners are advised by CDC not to visit the Miami neighborhood of Wynwood as four cases of the disease are reported in the small community and local mosquitoes are believed to be spreading the infection.    September 19, 2016 - CDC announces that it has successfully reduced the population of Zika-carrying mosquitoes in Wynwood and lifts its advisory against travel to the community by pregnant women.  November 18, 2016 - WHO declares that the Zika virus outbreak is no longer a public health emergency, shifting the focus to long-term plans to research the disease and birth defects linked to the virus. ""We are not downgrading the importance of Zika. By placing this as a long-term program of work, we are saying Zika is here to stay,"" says Dr. David Heymann of WHO.  November 22, 2016 - CDC announces that a section of North Miami Beach, where a cluster of Zika cases were reported, is no longer an area where the virus is being actively transmitted. November 28, 2016 - Health officials announce Texas has become the second state in the continental United States to confirm a locally transmitted case of the Zika virus. September 29, 2017 - CDC deactivates its emergency response for Zika virus, which was activated in January 2016.

The social media giant said Tuesday it had updated its rankings so people's news feeds will show fewer posts that, for example, assert a miracle cure or promote pills that promise to help you lose weight. ""Misleading health content is particularly bad for our community,"" Facebook product manager Travis Yeh said in a blog post. ""Pages should avoid posts about health that exaggerate or mislead people and posts that try to sell products using health-related claims."" The company said it would do this by identifying phrases that were commonly used in such posts. Facebook and other social media platforms have been criticized for failing to curb the spread of health-related misinformation online, particularly around vaccines. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta last month that the company has ""an obligation"" to provide its users with safe and accurate health information. Facebook announced in March that it was working to tackle vaccine misinformation on its platform by reducing the distribution of groups and pages that spread anti-vax content, and by rejecting ads that include misinformation about vaccines, among other strategies. ""It's taking us a while to ramp this [up] and we're working with experts around the world, but we're very, very committed to getting this right,"" Sandberg told CNN.

"79","Researchers have found a population of koalas that could be key to saving the species","article","Researchers have found a population of koalas that could be vital for stabilizing the koala population. Scientists from the University of Adelaide say they've found what could be the last Australian koalas totally free of chlamydia, according to a study published recently in the journal Nature Scientific Reports. Chlamydia is rampant in the primary koala habitat in New South Wales and Queensland on the country's eastern coast. A 17-year study published in 2017 characterized the koala population as in catastrophic decline. The disease is exacerbated by the stress that koalas feel from habitat loss, and the Australian government lists the tree-dwelling marsupials as ""vulnerable.""  The sexually transmitted bacterial infection, which causes blindness, female infertility and death, threatens to wipe out the species, according to the Australian Koala Foundation. ""This last large, isolated chlamydia-free population holds significant importance as insurance for the future of the species,"" Jessica Fabijan, an author of the study and a Ph.D. student at the University of Adelaide, said in a news release. ""We may need our Kangaroo Island koalas to re-populate other declining populations."" Zeroing in on the key koala population Researchers captured (and later released) 75 wild koalas from the Mount Lofty Ranges outside the southern city of Adelaide. They compared them with 170 koalas from  Kangaroo Island, about 8 miles off the coast of southern Australia. Veterinarians tested both groups for Chlamydia perocum and koala retrovirus. Of the koalas from the mainland, 47.5% had chlamydia, but not one of the koalas from the island had the infection or signs of the disease. On Kangaroo Island, the researchers estimate the koala population at about 50,000 and say that growing this koala population could help offset losses elsewhere. ""Future-proofing South Australia's koala health is paramount to ensuring the survival of the species in Australia, given the marked decline in the eastern states,"" said Brenton Grear, a spokesman for the South Australian Department for Environment and Water. Scientists are looking at a number of ways to push back against the chlamydia epidemic. In 2018, researchers announced that they had mapped the koala genome, fueling hopes for a vaccine against chlamydia. ""There are current trials of a Chlamydial vaccination in northern koalas to protect them from infection, but it is an uphill battle,"" Fabijan said. For now, the koalas on Kangaroo Island are the species' best hope.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/world/chlamydia-free-koalas-trnd/index.html","2019-07-02T22:33:06Z","2019-07-02T22:33:06Z","2019-07-02T22:33:06Z","cnn","By Ryan Prior, CNN","world","WORLD","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190702170404-01-koala-kangaroo-island-restricted-story-body.jpg"
"80","E. Coli Outbreaks Fast Facts","article","Here's a look at E. coli outbreaks in the United States. General Information: (from the CDC)
There are many strains of the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli). Most strains are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals.  Some kinds of E. coli cause disease by producing Shiga toxin. The bacteria that make these toxins are called ""Shiga toxin-producing"" E. coli (STEC). The most commonly found STEC in the United States is E. coli O157:H7.  The symptoms of STEC infections can include stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Some infections are mild, but others can be life-threatening. The CDC estimates that 265,000 STEC infections occur each year in the United States. E. coli O157:H7 causes more than 36% of these infections. People of all ages can be infected, but young children and the elderly are more likely to develop severe symptoms.  The types of E. coli that can cause illness can be transmitted through contaminated water or food, or through contact with people or animals. Prevention:
To avoid E. coli infections, experts advise to thoroughly cook meat, avoid unpasteurized dairy products and juices, avoid swallowing water while swimming and wash hands regularly.  1998 - The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points program (HACCP) begins requiring meat processors to establish critical checkpoints in the plants to prevent pathogens from contaminating meat.
- Inspectors from the food-safety agency randomly test all facilities that grind meat products to make sure that the plants are complying with the HACCP program. 1999 - The USDA approves the irradiation process for meat. Irradiation is a process that uses beams of high-speed electrons to kill E. coli and other bacteria. May 2000 - Huisken Meats of Sauk Rapids, Minnesota, becomes the first meat processor to begin selling irradiated ground beef to retailers. June 2009 - Epitopix LLC, a Minnesota-based veterinary pharmaceutical company, begins licensing a new vaccine for cows that reduces the transmission of E. coli between cows and humans.   Timeline of selected E. coli outbreaks in the United States:
Jack in the Box (E. coli O157:H7)
1992-1993 - The Jack in the Box outbreak kills three children and makes about 500 people sick in the Northwest United States.   The Jack in the Box incident leads the Bill Clinton administration to begin random testing for E. coli in ground beef. The meatpacking industry sues the USDA to block the tests. The USDA wins the lawsuit. ConAgra Beef Co. (E. coli O157:H7)
July 19, 2002 - Nineteen million pounds of meat produced at the ConAgra Beef Co.'s Greeley, Colorado, plant is recalled.  At least 35 people become ill due to this meat contamination and one person dies. The contaminated meat is shipped to at least 21 states. Prepackaged Spinach (E. coli O157:H7)
September 14, 2006 - The FDA issues a warning to consumers about an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak in multiple states. The warning states, ""preliminary epidemiological evidence suggests that bagged fresh spinach may be a possible cause of this outbreak."" Fall 2006 - At least 199 cases of E. coli infection occur in 26 states. Three people die and about 31 develop Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a dangerous complication that can lead to kidney failure. The outbreak is most severe in Wisconsin, where 49 cases are reported to the FDA, and one death is confirmed. The source of the outbreak is traced to fresh, bagged spinach from the California-based Natural Selection Foods company, which issues a voluntary recall of its spinach products. October 2006 - The FDA matches the E. coli strain to one found on a cattle ranch located next to the spinach fields in Salinas Valley. Taco Bell/Taco John's (E. coli O157:H7)
November 29, 2006 - An outbreak begins in New Jersey and New York at nine different Taco Bell locations. December 5, 2006 - Taco Bell announces the removal of green onions from Taco Bell restaurants nationwide in response to preliminary tests suggesting they are the cause of the E. coli outbreak. December 14, 2006 - The CDC reports that 71 people in five states have fallen ill from the strain of E. coli bacteria involved in the Taco Bell outbreak. Topp's Ground Beef Patties (E. coli O157:H7)
September 25, 2007 - Topps Meat Company issues a recall of its frozen burgers after six people fall ill and three are hospitalized due to E. coli from Topps burgers. September 29, 2007 - Topps Meat expands its recall to 21.7 million pounds of ground beef products. The company announces a week later that it is going out of business.  October 26, 2007 - An update is released - 40 cases of E. coli identified. At least 21 people are hospitalized and two developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Cheese (E. coli O157:H7)
November 5, 2010 - Thirty-eight people from five states are sickened from cheese sold at Costco. Fifteen are hospitalized and one suffers from hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a form of kidney failure. November 23, 2010 - Bravo Farms recalls all its cheeses. Chipotle (E. coli O26)
October 31, 2015 - Health officials in Washington and Oregon announce that an outbreak of E. coli infections may be linked to food served at Chipotle restaurants in Washington and Oregon. November 3, 2015 - Chipotle announces it has closed 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington.  November 20, 2015 - The CDC reports 45 people in six states have been infected with E. coli. The six states are Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota, New York and Ohio. The report says evidence suggests that ""a common meal item or ingredient served at Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants...is a likely source of this outbreak.""  December 4, 2015 - The CDC reports that an additional seven people have been infected. Three new states, Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania have reported cases. This brings the total to 52 people infected in nine states. December 21, 2015 - The CDC reports that an additional person has been infected in Pennsylvania, for a total of 53 people infected.  February 1, 2016 - The CDC says the Chipotle outbreaks ""appear to be over."" I.M. Healthy Brand SoyNut Butter (E. coli O157:H7)
January 4, 2017-February 21, 2017 - A nine-state outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC O157:H7) occurs. Sixteen people fall ill and eight are hospitalized. March 3, 2017 - The CDC investigates the multi-state outbreak. ""Epidemiologic evidence available at this time indicates that I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut Butter is a likely source of this outbreak. SoyNut Butter is a nut-free substitute for peanut butter."" March 7, 2017 - The SoyNut Butter Company announces the voluntary recall of all varieties of I.M. Healthy SoyNut Butters and I.M. Healthy Granola products. March 30, 2017 - The FDA says no food products may be sold or distributed by the Dixie Dew Products, Inc. facility in Erlinger, Kentucky, because they may be contaminated with E. coli. Dixie Dew is I.M. Healthy's contracted soy nut butter manufacturer. May 4, 2017 - The CDC announces that the outbreak investigation is over. To date, 32 illnesses have been reported from 12 states.  Romaine Lettuce (E. coli O157:H7)
April 10, 2018 - The CDC says it's investigating a multistate outbreak of E. coli infections.  April 13, 2018 - The CDC reports that its investigation is focused on chopped romaine lettuce from the Yuma, Arizona, region. According to the CDC, 35 people from 11 states have fallen ill.  April 18, 2018 - In an update, the CDC reports that 53 people from 16 states have been infected. A total of 95% of those sickened said they ate romaine lettuce before the illness started.   April 20, 2018 - The CDC expands its warning to include all forms of romaine lettuce from the Yuma area, including whole heads and hearts, not just chopped.

"81","Researchers eliminated HIV from the DNA of infected mice. It's the first step toward a cure for humans, they say","article","Researchers have successfully eliminated HIV from the DNA of infected mice, a promising step toward a cure for the nearly 37 million people living with the virus.  In a study published Tuesday in Nature Communications, researchers from Temple University's Lewis Katz School of Medicine and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) coupled genome editing technology with a slow-release virus suppression drug to eliminate HIV cells entirely from some infected mice.  Current HIV treatment cannot eliminate the virus entirely but does suppress its replication. Antiretroviral therapy, or ART, requires lifelong use to stall the virus' spread and, as a May study found, can potentially end the transmission of HIV between sexual partners.  Testing their methods on a group of infected ""humanized mice,"" or rodents engineered to produce human T cells susceptible to HIV, researchers administered a treatment called LASER ART, or long-acting, slow-effective release ART, to suppress HIV cells from replicating.  The team modified the drug for a slow release across several weeks, targeting tissue in the spleen, bone marrow and brain where latent HIV reservoirs, or clusters of inactive HIV cells, were likely to occur.  To eliminate the remaining infective cells from the subject's DNA, they employed a gene editing tool called CRISPR-Cas9.  The process allowed the teams to ""clean segments of the genome"" and remove the HIV chromosome, co-author Kamel Khalili told CNN.  By the study's end, researchers had successfully eliminated the virus from nine out of 23 mice.  The results prove that HIV can be eliminated, researchers say The two labs initially began their research separately: Howard Gendelman at UNMC pursued trials with LASER ART, while Khalili at Temple University had been tampering with CRISPR technology for five years.  They combined their efforts to attempt complete elimination of the virus. And their lofty goal required a unique approach.  Khalili said he treated HIV as a genetic disease: Once the virus infects a subject, the viral genome enters into the chromosome and becomes a ""bad gene,"" he said.  Combination therapy was a prime way to attack HIV from both angles: Slow its spread first with LASER ART, then edit it out completely with CRISPR.  To confirm they'd eradicated the virus, a process that took years, Gendelman told CNN the team examined every ""nook and cranny"" of the mice's tissue where infected cells may lurk.  The results are proof that elimination of HIV is possible—but they're just a first step, not a leap straight to cure, he cautioned.  ""We're landing on the moon,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean you made it to Mars yet.""  Khalili's labs have been working on a version of the study with primates, though it'll take between 9 months to one year to discern if the virus is eradicated. A paper based on the short-term results of gene editing in primates could be published within the year, he said.  If their methods continue to prove successful, clinical trials could follow as soon as next summer, he said.  Recent attempts to cure HIV have sparked hope  Hope for a cure swelled in March when researchers announced a second person had been effectively rid of HIV after a stem cell transplant successfully eliminated any trace of the virus from his blood.  Both patients, known as the London and Berlin patients, were treated with stem cell transplants from donors born with the CCR5 genetic mutation that made them resistant to the virus. The men, already infected with HIV, were diagnosed with forms of cancer when they received the treatment.  The London patient had been in sustained remission for 18 months at the time the article was published, researchers said.  In 2018, an HIV vaccine concept got the go-ahead for further testing after a study found it induced an immune response in humans and monkeys. Its effectiveness in protecting humans from the virus is still unknown.

"82","How California made a 'dramatic' impact on kindergartners getting vaccinated","article","There are now five states in the United States that do not offer personal, philosophical or religious exemptions from school vaccination requirements: California, Mississippi, West Virginia, Maine and New York. The idea behind these controversial state laws -- which have received opposition from anti-vaccination activists -- is that requiring more children to get vaccinated, unless they have a medical reason not to, can help reduce the spread of disease.  Yet does such strict legislation really lead to more children being up-to-date on their vaccine requirements? A new study suggests yes, at least in California. The new study involved analyzing annual data about kindergartners and their vaccination status at the start of school between 2000 and 2017. They looked at the data before and after three specific interventions took place: two vaccine-related policies and one education campaign. The yearly rate of kindergartners without an up-to-date vaccination status rose from 7.8% in the year 2000 to 9.84% in 2013 -- before the policies and campaign -- and then the rate fell to 4.87% in 2017 -- after the policies and campaign -- according to the study published in the medical journal JAMA on Tuesday. In 2014, when California did allow personal exemptions, a bill passed that required parents in the state to submit proof they had discussed the risks of not vaccinating their children with a health care practitioner prior to obtaining a personal belief exemption. Then in 2015, the California Department of Public Health and local health departments launched a campaign to educate school staff on the proper application of admission criteria, giving students more time to catch up on vaccinations. In 2016, California implemented a bill banning all personal belief exemptions. A Disneyland-linked measles outbreak that hit California around that time was cited as the catalyst for the legislation.  ""We noted a big decrease in the likelihood that a not-up-to-date kindergartener would have contact with another not-up-to-date kindergartner within their school,"" the study's first author Cassandra Pingali, a fellow at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Immunization Services Division in Atlanta, said in an email. CDC was not involved in the study, as Pingali conducted the research while she was a graduate student at Emory University.  ""These results indicate that a vaccine preventable disease outbreak is less likely to occur, and the interventions were effective at increasing vaccination rates in California kindergartners,"" she said. The study included publicly available data on kindergarten enrollment and vaccination status from the California Department of Public Health between 2000 and 2017. During that time period, about 9.3 million children started attending kindergarten across more than 10,000 California schools, according to the study. The study had some limitations, including that only schools with 10 or more students were included in the data, the analysis only involved the time between 2000 and 2017, and more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge in other states. Two of the study authors also reported financial ties to Pfizer and other companies.  The study itself was funded by the National Institutes of Health. All in all, ""health policy does not occur in a vacuum, and California was responding rapidly to address disease outbreaks in the state,"" Pingali said in the email. The study suggests that legislative activity can make a real-world impact, said Dr. Peter Hotez, who was not involved in the study but is a vaccine researcher and dean of the national school of tropical medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He is also the author of a book about his daughter, ""Vaccines did not Cause Rachel's Autism."" ""What they haven't done is they haven't looked past 2017 in this study,"" Hotez said. That data would be valuable as other US states might also begin closing vaccine exemptions to prevent the return of measles. So, he said, in California, ""with those legislative interventions there was an immediate and dramatic impact. The question then becomes: Is this sustainable?"" Dr. Matthew Davis and Seema Shah, both affiliated with Northwestern University, co-authored an editorial that published in JAMA alongside the new study on Tuesday. ""Although the study did not measure actual outbreaks of disease, reductions in children's risk of contracting measles are a promising outcome in California resulting from policy changes,"" Davis and Shah wrote in the editorial. They added that the study findings ""suggest that adopting this policy nationwide could substantively limit outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/health/california-vaccine-laws-study/index.html","2019-07-02T17:55:51Z","2019-07-02T17:58:00Z","2019-07-02T17:58:00Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150210154413-vaccines-2-cfb-story-body.jpg"
"83","A Kentucky teen sued to attend school without a chickenpox vaccine. He just lost in court -- again","article","A Kentucky court of appeals sided with a health department after a teen sued the department over a policy that barred him from attending school without receiving the chickenpox vaccination. Jerome Kunkel sued his local health department in March after he refused to get the vaccine citing his Christian faith. Boone County Circuit Judge James Schrand sided with the Northern Kentucky Health Department in April, rejecting Kunkel's request to prevent the health department from enforcing a policy that temporarily barred students at his school who weren't immune against chickenpox from attending classes and participating in extracurricular activities. The Commonwealth of Kentucky Court of appeals denied the teen's request for an injunction in the case on Monday. The Northern Kentucky Health Department announced in March that all students at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart/Assumption Academy in Walton, Kentucky, where Kunkel was enrolled, needed to have proof they were vaccinated before they could attend school after 32 people were affected during an outbreak. The policy stated that all students at the school without ""proof of vaccination or proof of immunity against chickenpox will not be allowed to attend school until 21 days after the onset of rash for the last ill student or staff member.""  As a result, Kunkel was told he couldn't attend school or play in any upcoming basketball games. Kunkel sued the health department and told CNN affiliate WLWT that he was being discriminated against because of his religious beliefs.
In response to Kunkel's lawsuit, the health department said its policy ""was in direct response to a public health threat and was an appropriate and necessary response to prevent further spread of this contagious illness."" Kunkel was diagnosed with chicken pox in May, two months after going to court over the policy, and was able to return to school shortly after, his attorney Christopher Wiest told CNN.  Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease that causes a blister-like rash, itching, fever and tiredness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus spreads by contact with infected individuals. The CDC recommends against people intentionally exposing children to chickenpox in hope that they get the disease.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/health/kentucky-chicken-pox-injunction-denied/index.html","2019-07-02T10:14:21Z","2019-07-02T10:14:21Z","2019-07-02T10:14:21Z","cnn","By Hollie Silverman and Mirna Alsharif, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190508172943-jerome-kunkel-chickenpox-story-body.jpg"
"84","CDC panel recommends hepatitis A vaccination through age 18 and for HIV patients","article","Amid a surge in hepatitis A cases across the United States, an advisory panel for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending vaccination against the virus for children and teens who have not been immunized, as well as HIV patients. Previously, hepatitis A vaccination was recommended for children ages 12 to 23 months. On Thursday, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP, voted unanimously to recommend that children and adolescents who have not previously received a hepatitis A vaccine be vaccinated at any age from 2 through 18. ""The goal here is to catch them up on their vaccination at a time when we know they are more likely to seek medical care,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, acting director of the CDC's Center for Preparedness and Response, said in the meeting. The committee also voted unanimously to recommend that people ages 1 or older with with HIV be vaccinated.  The ACIP recommendations won't be official until they're approved by the CDC director.  The votes were made during a meeting at the CDC in Atlanta. The committee holds three meetings every year to review the most recent scientific data and vote on making possible updates to vaccine recommendations. Last year the committee unanimously voted to recommend the use of routine hepatitis A vaccination for all homeless people ages 1 year and older to protect them against infection. Hepatitis A rates in the United States declined by more than 95% since the vaccine first became available in 1995, according to the CDC. But the liver disease made a resurgence among adults in the United States, according to a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published in May. They found that hepatitis A infections increased 294% between 2016 and 2018. Adults who have not received the vaccine or previously had the infection remain vulnerable from contaminated food and, on a larger scale, through behaviors such as drug use, according to the report. The virus can also spread from close personal or sexual contact with an infected person. The rise in the number of cases is also a consequence of the nation's opioid crisis, the report's authors added. ""Increasing vaccination among groups at risk for hepatitis A infection might halt ongoing outbreaks and prevent future outbreaks,"" the authors explained. Common symptoms of hepatitis A include stomach pain, low appetite, nausea, fatigue and jaundice, and they usually end within two months, once the body clears the infection. Most people who get hepatitis A recover completely and don't have lasting liver damage, but in rare cases, the infection can cause liver failure and even death.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/health/hepatitis-a-vaccine-recommendations-acip-bn/index.html","2019-06-27T20:08:45Z","2019-06-27T20:08:45Z","2019-06-27T20:08:45Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180705174839-hepatitis-story-body.jpg"
"85","CDC panel recommends HPV vaccine for men through age 26 and for some older adults","article","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP, voted unanimously on Wednesday to recommend HPV vaccines for both boys and girls and men and women through age 26. Previously the CDC recommended that teen girls and young women who had not been adequately vaccinated receive the human papillomavirus vaccine through age 26, but the recommendation for teen boys and young men only went through age 21. The CDC's recommendation that children start receiving two doses of the HPV vaccine around 11 or 12 years old has not changed. In a 10-4 vote, the committee also recommended adults ages 27 through 45 who had not been adequately vaccinated make shared decisions with their doctors about getting vaccinated. Adults older than 45 who had not been vaccinated are not advised to do so, since HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in that age group. The ACIP recommendations won't be official until they're approved by the CDC director. The votes were made during a meeting at the CDC in Atlanta. The committee holds three meetings every year to review the most recent scientific data and vote on making possible updates to vaccine recommendations. Several mothers and anti-vaccination advocates spoke out against vaccines during the public comment portion of the meeting, referencing concerns around vaccine safety and potential harms. Following the vote, Dr. Christopher Zahn, vice president of practice activities at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, praised the ACIP decision in a written statement. ""Today's decision from ACIP emphasizes what the data has shown -- that the HPV vaccine is safe and effective for use in patients ages 27 to 45, and that use of the vaccine in this age group should be the result of shared decision-making between patients and their trusted physicians,"" Zahn said. The recommendations for catch-up vaccinations to extend through age 26 ""should match"" between men and women, Dr. Anna-Barbara Moscicki, division chief of adolescent and young adult medicine at UCLA Health and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in an email. ""The simpler the better,"" Moscicki, who was not involved in the ACIP meeting, said in the email. HPV infection can lead to cancer Human papillomavirus or HPV is a group of more than 200 related viruses, which can spread through sexual contact. In some cases, HPV infection can lead to six types of cancer: cervical, anal, penile, vaginal, vulvar and oropharyngeal (mouth and throat). In the United States, high-risk HPV infections cause about 3% of all cancers in women and 2% in men, according to the National Cancer Institute.  Worldwide, the impact of HPV-related cancers is greater, with high-risk infections causing about 5% of all cancers globally, according to the institute. The vaccine can protect against cancers since it works by preventing HPV infection -- and while most people think of HPV's relation to cervical cancer, ""parents often don't know that HPV oropharyngeal cancers will outnumber cervical cancer"" in around five years, Moscicki said. About 10% of men and 3.6% of women have oral HPV, according to the CDC, and HPV is thought to cause 70% of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States.  Earlier this month, actress and ""Desperate Housewives"" star Marcia Cross opened up about her battle with anal cancer. Cross, 57, revealed her diagnosis in a series of Instagram photos in 2018. Her husband, Tom Mahoney, was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2009. Doctors now suspect that Cross' cancer and Mahoney's came from the same type of HPV. Cross said at the time she planned to get her 12-year-old twin daughters vaccinated. The actress told CNN she cares deeply about being able to ""educate the public about HPV.""  ""In spite of the optics, I care deeply about saving lives,"" Cross previously wrote in an email to CNN. ""To that end, the important thing to do is to educate the public about HPV. It is so common that nearly every person who is sexually active will get it at some point in their lifetime. HPV can cause cervical and other cancers .... It can take years, even decades to develop."" 'Strong evidence' for cervical cancer prevention A new study, published in the journal The Lancet on Wednesday, found ""compelling evidence"" of HPV vaccination programs leading to significant declines in HPV infections. The study was a review and analysis of 65 separate papers in 14 high-income countries previously published between 2014 and 2018 on certain HPV-related health consequences, such as infections or anogenital warts, before and after vaccination periods.   The analysis of these previous studies showed that, after five to eight years of vaccination, the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased significantly by 83% among girls aged 13 to 19, by 66% among women aged 20 to 24 and by 37% among women aged 25 to 29. These types of HPV cause 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancerous cervical lesions, according to the World Health Organization. The study also found significant decreases in anogenital wart diagnoses in both girls and women and boys and men. ""Our results provide strong evidence that HPV vaccination works to prevent cervical cancer in real-world settings as both HPV infections that cause most cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions are decreasing,"" the study's first author Mélanie Drolet of the CHU de Quebec-Laval University Research Center said in a press release  ""We saw that programmes with multiple age cohorts of girls vaccinated and high vaccination coverage have greater direct impact and herd effects. This finding reinforces WHO's recently revised position on HPV vaccination to recommend HPV vaccination of multiple age cohorts of girls aged 9-14 years old when the vaccine is introduced in a country, rather than vaccination of a single cohort,"" Drolet said.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/health/hpv-vaccine-age-recommendations-acip-bn/index.html","2019-06-26T20:50:24Z","2019-06-27T01:31:40Z","2019-06-27T01:31:40Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190204183938-vph-virus-papiloma-humano-eliminacion-cura-ipn-investigadora-ciencia-cancer-cervicouterino-eva-ramon-vo-perspectivas-mexico-00001702-story-body.jpg"
"86","Tuberculosis (TB) Fast Facts","article","Here's a look at some information on Tuberculosis (also known as TB), an infection, caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that usually affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain.  About TB:
Two types of TB exist - Latent TB infection (non-infectious) and TB disease (infectious). Latent TB infection:
- A person infected with latent TB shows no sign of symptoms and may not feel sick.
- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.
- It is not possible to spread the TB bacteria from the infected person to others.
- Individuals with a latent TB infection may never develop the disease, as bacteria remains dormant. In other cases, especially involving people with a weak immune system, the bacteria may become active and cause TB disease.
- Treatment is required to ensure the infected person does not develop active TB disease but in some cases preventative treatment may not be an option. 
- Without treatment, about 5-10% of individuals infected with latent TB will develop the disease.  TB disease:
- Symptoms of TB of the lungs include coughing up blood and chest pain.
- Other symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills and fatigue.
- It is possible to spread the TB bacteria from the infected person to others.
- A skin or blood test will indicate if a person has been infected with the bacteria.
- Treatment involves a combination of drugs taken for six to nine months.
- Persons with a weak immune system, such as those with HIV or diabetes mellitus, are more prone to catching the TB disease. 
- TB is one of the leading causes of death for people infected with HIV worldwide.  Facts:
TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings. Germs can stay in the air for hours.  TB germs are not spread via sharing food, shaking hands and touching toilet seats.  Approximately two billion people, one-third of the world's population, are infected with latent TB. In 2018, a total of 9,029 new TB cases were reported in the United States, the lowest case count on record in the United States.  Still, the CDC cautions that a recent model predicted that the goal of TB elimination in the United States will not be attained during the 21st century without greatly increased investment in detection and treatment of latent TB infection.   Timeline:
1546 - Italian scientist Girolamo Fracastoro hypothesizes that TB is contagious.  1679 - Dutch scientist Francis Sylvius details the impact of TB on patients.  1865 - French military doctor Jean-Antoine Villemin proves the illness can transmit from human to animal or from animal to animal.  1882 - German doctor Robert Koch identifies the bacterial strain as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 1800s - Tuberculosis causes as much as one-quarter of all deaths in Europe during the 19th century. Famous people who die from tuberculosis include John Keats, Frédéric Chopin, Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte, Anton Chekhov and Franz Kafka.   1921 - After years of trials involving animal testing, French bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin successfully administer a vaccine called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in an infant whose mother died of TB. 1930 - In Germany, more than 70 infants who received the BCG vaccine die of TB. It is later concluded that the vaccine was contaminated in the lab.  1944 - Microbiologist, Selman A. Waksman and his associates at Rutgers University reports the discovery of a new antibiotic called streptomycin. 1944 - Physicians H. Corwin Hinshaw, Karl H. Pfuetze and William H. Feldman successfully use streptomycin to treat a patient with TB. 1952 - A scientific journal publishes studies heralding the success of a breakthrough treatment called isoniazid.   1985-1992 - Tuberculosis makes a resurgence. Scientists attribute this to factors including the spread of HIV.  1994 - The World Health Organization declares tuberculosis a global emergency.  1995 - The WHO launches Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course (DOTS). It is a treatment plan containing five components including standardized recording and reporting.   2008 - The WHO reports the highest rates of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) worldwide.  December 8, 2010 - The WHO endorses a new test that diagnoses tuberculosis within hours instead of months. May 26, 2011 - Nearly 700 patients and 100 employees are exposed to tuberculosis at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after interacting with a hospital employee carrying the disease. 2013-2014 - A sick employee at a Texas hospital exposes more than 700 infants and 43 staffers to tuberculosis.  2015 - Three hundred and fifty infants as well as 368 mothers or parents are potentially exposed to tuberculosis at a California medical center. Those exposed may have interacted with an employee who had TB and worked in the nursery.  2018 - A promising new vaccine called M72/AS01E is shown to be effective in many people already infected with TB.

"87","Why this 7-year-old can't go anywhere near unvaccinated children","article","When his daughter Angela was gravely ill, Nicola Pomaro made her a solemn promise: If she recovered, he would do all he could to help her live life to the full. Angela was just 3 years old when she was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disorder that meant her body could not produce enough red blood cells. It left her needing a bone marrow transplant.   But when Angela got better and developed a love of dance Pomaro, from Padua in northeastern Italy, was faced with a dilemma: How to find a ballet school where she would be safe from disease in a country which had one of the highest rates of measles in the world in 2017, according to the World Health Organization. Like thousands of other transplant recipients in Italy, Angela, has little or no immunity. Going about her daily life can be a gamble. Public places like trains, airplanes, shopping malls and cinemas are all out of bounds for the 7-year-old.  Northeastern Italy has been a hotbed of the anti-vaccine movement since a judge in Rimini ruled in 2012 that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as MMR, caused autism.  Claims of a link between MMR and autism -- first suggested by disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield in a since-retracted 1998 study -- have been widely discredited. The Rimini judge's ruling was overturned three years later, but by then it had encouraged the spread of anti-vaccine theories in Italy and around the world.  Safe, but secluded For Angela, the risk in her region was so great that she lived in virtual seclusion for two years, unable to attend school and seeing just one vaccinated playmate and her former kindergarten teacher.  Even her elder brother Pietro, now 18, had to be sent away to stay with his grandparents every time he had the slightest cold. Two years ago, Angela's life began to change, after Italy's previous government made vaccinations mandatory by excluding non-immunized children from schools. Since then, the incidence of measles has halved and vaccination coverage among the whole population has improved to 92%. It has not yet reached the 95% needed to ensure ""herd immunity"" required to protect people with impaired immune systems, like Angela.  But now, with populist parties the League and the Five Star Movement -- both of which have embraced anti-vaccine sentiment -- in power, the brief freedom Angela has gained is under threat once more. ""Being sociable, Angela really suffered being isolated from her friends for so long,"" says Pomaro, 53. ""She began to fall behind in terms of her development and schooling and so eventually, as a family, we were advised to start taking some risks for her benefit, "" he says. ""It would be a great shame to go back and erase the small gains that have been made."" Just a year after its introduction, Italy's mandatory vaccination program has already been watered down, allowing parents of children Angela's age to pay a fine, or to self-certify that their offspring have been immunized, even if they have not.  Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister and the head of the League party, has hinted he may reverse the policy altogether, in order to prioritize school attendance instead. To preempt such a move, Pomaro and his wife Federica enrolled Angela in a school that mostly serves the children of migrants. The population is much maligned by Salvini, but they are statistically more likely to take up their shots. High-income, low trust Though vulnerable to anti-establishment rhetoric thanks to years of dysfunctional government, Italy is not alone in finding a growing number of its citizens questioning crucial public health initiatives. A survey by UK medical charity the Wellcome Trust found that inhabitants of high-income countries have the lowest confidence that vaccines are safe, with 20% of Europeans reporting that they were unsure about their risks, compared to their benefits.  One of those is Loris Mazzorato, 55. Like Pomaro, he too is a father of young children -- his daughter Anita, 8, is just a year older than Angela. The families live a half-hour's drive from each other, but on the subject of vaccines, they are worlds apart.  A former League party mayor of the town of Resana, Mazzorato once used his public office to lobby parents not to immunize their children when he registered their births, sending their certificates back accompanied by 25 pages of anti-vaccine propaganda. Armed with little more than a high school diploma -- and no scientific background -- Mazzorato has emerged as one of the most vocal proponents of an anti-vaccine movement that now encompasses an estimated 1% of Italy's population. He travels the country giving speeches, with placards strapped to his children's stroller. He has even draped banners proclaiming his anti-vaccine message from the balcony of his home. 'It's like being in a war' For Mazzorato, it is as much about protecting his children's bodies from the harmful substances he believes are inside the vaccines as it is fighting for his rights as a parent against what he views as an encroaching government. ""It's like being in a war. Either you shoot first or you get shot,"" he says. ""It's about freedom of choice. Each parent should have the right to choose what is right for their child and what is wrong.  ""Besides,"" he adds, ""getting sick makes you stronger, and we live in a developed country where these risks aren't there anymore.""  Measles can be a dangerous illness, leading to serious complications and hospitalization. One to three out of 1,000 people with measles will die, even with high quality health care, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As his second daughter, Illaria, 2, prepares to enter nursery school without vaccinations in the fall, he says he will home school her if she is excluded. When asked about the risk his family's decisions pose for those in Angela's situation, Mazzorato, who does not believe in herd immunity, is unapologetic, asking why he should inject his children with what he sees as ""potentially harmful substances.""  For all Mazzorato's heartfelt beliefs, the numbers tell a different story: Italy has seen almost 900 cases of measles so far this year. In 2018, there were more than 2,600, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO has labeled resistance to vaccines one of the biggest risks to global public health in 2019.  Death threats For another father at the forefront of the struggle, speaking out against the threat of deadly disease has resulted in the threat of death -- for him and for his daughter, Caterina, 8. As a professor of microbiology at Milan's Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Roberto Burioni, 56, says he also became ""mobilized"" when Caterina reached school age.  ""I realised how much disinformation there was out there and felt really, as a father, as a doctor, I had to do something about it,"" he says. Burioni says the decision by populist politicians to fan the flames of anti-vaccination sentiment is ""really unfortunate."" ""Health, treatments or preventions should not be something which is left or right,"" he says. ""If you find a cure for a disease it is for everybody. And I think it is very bad that somebody is taking political stances on these issues where the safety of the whole community is at stake."" Burioni wrote a book, called ""Deadly Lies,"" and has campaigned heavily for mandatory vaccinations, amassing almost a half-million followers on Facebook. But his work has also attracted negative attention; he was sent pictures of guns and bullets with his wife and daughter's name on them via Twitter. ""It has been really unpleasant,"" he says. ""All I am trying to do is to tell people, as a scientist, that two plus two equals four.  ""We have a really dramatic situation in Italy. In a country like this, how many cases should there be? Zero, because people should be vaccinated, it's as simple as that."" Freedom from disease Angela's father has managed to recreate that perfect world free from disease for his daughter, for now at least. After months of searching, he has found a dance teacher willing to create a special class just for her, filled with other children who have all been vaccinated. So what is Pomaro's message for parents with doubts about the safety of vaccines? ""Think about children like Angela, "" he says. ""They have been through so much and survived, only to suffer once more for the sake of superstition. ""I wish I could vaccinate her ... but I can't.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/health/italy-anti-vaccine-children-on-frontline-intl/index.html","2019-06-26T07:32:05Z","2019-06-26T07:32:05Z","2019-06-26T07:32:05Z","cnn","By Nina dos Santos, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190621132002-03-italy-anti-vax-movement-story-body.jpg"
"88","'Crowding diseases' threaten migrant children held in US border protection facilities, expert says","article","Widespread hygiene problems at several US Customs and Border Protection facilities pose ""a great many health risks"" for the children housed in them, according to Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatrician and director of the University of Michigan's Center for the History of Medicine. In May, nearly 133,000 migrants, including more than 11,000 unaccompanied children, were arrested for crossing the border illegally, according to Customs and Border Protection data.  Overcrowding at some US border facilities resulting from this spike in detentions could lead to a ""health crisis,"" a team of doctors, lawyers and advocates warned last week. Describing conditions at the Ursula Processing Center in McAllen, Attorney Toby Gialluca said ""virtually everyone we saw was ill,"" while Clara Long, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the unaccompanied minors being held at a Border Patrol station in Clint ""had colds and were sick"" and also ""didn't have access to soap to wash their hands."" The dangers are real, said Markel, who explained that ""crowding diseases"" easily spread when too many people share beds or too small a living space. Lice can spread typhus Children who do not wash regularly are likely to pick up body lice and ""some of those lice could carry typhus,"" said Markel.  Fever, headaches and sometimes rash are common symptoms of epidemic typhus fever, which has the potential to spread rapidly among people living in close quarters, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""That could very well happen,"" said Markel, who has not visited the facilities. Untreated, typhus fever can become life-threatening, though antibiotics provide a common cure.  Other possible risks include common colds and even influenza, said Markel, adding that while it is not the season, flu is a possibility at any time of year.  As any parent knows, young children do not always practice good ""respiratory hygiene,"" said Markel; They often fail to cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing and do not always wipe their noses. So respiratory illnesses can ""very easily spread"" in overcrowded situations.   Crowding is associated with increased risks of tuberculosis, according to the World Health Organization.  Diarrheal diseases, including contagious rotavirus causing watery diarrhea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain (mostly among infants and young children), are another risk when children are too tightly housed.    Cholera, another diarrheal illness spread by feces contaminated water or food, is ""unlikely,"" still a crowded facility is ""a good way to spread it,"" said Markel.  Germs could travel from migrants to US community He recalled a cholera epidemic of the 19th century that many believe transferred from immigrants to ""some of the people watching over them."" If those within the immigrant facilities develop cholera, ""it could very easily get into the community at large,"" said Markel, who added that it benefits us all to not have places where disease festers because germs don't respect borders or social differences: ""Germs travel."" Add to that, the general level of vaccination among the children is unknown, and ""given the poverty of some of these children,"" many may not have received all or some of their shots, said Markel. Key childhood inoculations that protect against highly contagious and life-threatening illnesses include the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella), the DTaP vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough) and the polio vaccine. ""The greater the crowding the riskier the situation on every level,"" said Markel, who added mental trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder, to the list of possible afflictions found within the facilities.  ""The trek could not have been easy,"" he said. Along the way, some of the kids might have been abused or temporarily or permanently separated from their parents. ""The reunification of these split families has not gone as smoothly as we would have hoped,"" said Markel.  Meanwhile, possible turf skirmishes or mob mentality happening right now may be scarring some of the children as we speak, he said.   Markel said much of what's happening now is reminiscent of the 19th Century, when a swelling number of immigrants aroused concerns about the potential spread of infectious diseases. In 1891, the federal government took control of the nation's borders and initiated medical inspections (and in some cases mandatory exclusion of those diagnosed with infectious diseases) for immigrants by the United States Public Health Service. All told, possible mental and physical health risks are rife within the Texas border protection facilities Markel said. ""We knew this at Ellis Island, we don't need to relearn this,"" he said. ""But apparently we do.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/health/crowding-diseases-border-protection-facilities/index.html","2019-06-24T17:52:47Z","2019-06-24T17:52:47Z","2019-06-24T17:52:47Z","cnn","By Susan Scutti, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190402121342-01-el-paso-border-file-story-body.jpg"
"89","These dogs are getting a cancer vaccine. If it works, humans could be next","article","If you ask most experts in the cancer community, creating a wide-ranging vaccine that prevents tumors like we prevent infectious diseases is damn near impossible.  The idea may be tantalizing, but study after study over the past several decades has taught doctors that cancer is personal. Everyone's looks different on a molecular level. And each tumor is an agile, devious adversary that mutates as it grows to outwit the human immune system.  ""They may be right,"" Stephen Johnston says, but ""if the chance is 10% that it might work, I can't see any reason why we shouldn't take that chance.""  Johnston isn't an oncologist. He's a scientist, inventor and director of Arizona State University's Center for Innovations in Medicine. He recently launched a clinical trial to test a cancer vaccine in hundreds of dogs across the country. The trial will examine whether the vaccine delays or prevents a variety of cancers in healthy, older dogs. If it's successful, Johnston says, it could lay the groundwork for developing a similar vaccine for humans. Why dogs? Johnston initially wanted to test the vaccine in humans, but the cost and approval process were proving to be major roadblocks. Then Johnston met veterinarian Doug Thamm. Thamm is a cancer survivor and director of clinical research at Colorado State University's Flint Animal Cancer Center. ""Cancer is actually the leading cause of death in adult dogs,"" Thamm says. ""They develop these tumors spontaneously as a result of old age in a way that's very, very similar to the way humans do.""  Many canine cancers are also similar to human cancers on a molecular level. This has a lot to do with our shared environments, Thamm explains -- we breathe the same air, drink the same water, run on lawns sprayed with the same chemicals. Thamm told Johnston dogs are also ideal for a study like this because they don't live as long as humans, so researchers will be able to see whether the vaccine works in three to five years instead of 10 to 30.    So Thamm and Johnston decided to undertake what they say is the largest interventional clinical trial ever in canines. It's called the Vaccination Against Canine Cancer Study. As part of the trial, veterinarians screen the volunteer participants for any health problems. Half of the dogs will receive the vaccine and the other half will receive a placebo. Neither the owners nor the vets know which dogs are getting the vaccine, so they can't impact the study results. The dogs will receive four doses initially, and then yearly boosters for five years as long as the study continues.  It's a clinical trial model that's worked before, says Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, the interim chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society. The cancer drug Imbruvica, for example, was first tested in dogs before being developed for humans.     There are two possible outcomes, says Thamm. ""One is there is less cancer in the dogs that get the vaccine. That would be a huge victory.""  ""A second outcome that could be, I would argue, almost as valuable, is if we delay the onset of cancer. If we have a 9-year-old dog who would normally get cancer at 10 and instead that dog doesn't get cancer until 12, that's two more years of healthy life that we can potentially provide."" Of course, there's a third possibility: that the vaccine doesn't work at all.  Thamm emphasizes that they are not inducing cancer in the dogs participating in the trial; the dogs will be given the vaccine and then followed in their normal environments for the next several years.  ""Owners have really been overwhelmingly positive about the idea behind this trial. They, of course, loved the idea that they have the potential to participate in research that might help other dogs, and even people in the future."" CNN reached out to PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which said the study appears to be similar to human clinical trials where the subjects are volunteers and allowed to continue to live in their own homes. PETA opposes experiments where animals are held in artificial conditions and then killed.   How it works  Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize dangerous invaders quickly and fight back. The same way an athlete develops muscle memory during training, vaccines help your immune system develop memory cells so antibodies can respond better and faster to antigens (any foreign cell or substance that triggers an immune response).  In other words, vaccines prepare your body so that in the case of war -- your body vs. XYZ infection -- your body wins.  The problem with developing a cancer vaccine is that cancer cells are pretty complicated, Lichtenfeld says. They don't look nearly as foreign to the immune system as viruses like the flu or measles do. They have multiple proteins, so it's difficult to target specific antigens that exist across several types of cancer. And there's obviously a big risk in giving altered cancer cells to humans.  The concept of cancer vaccines has been around for decades, he says. But they're primarily therapeutic vaccines, given to treat patients who have been diagnosed with cancer. Therapeutic vaccines are often personalized using cancer cells from the patient to boost their immune response, so they can be expensive -- often costing patients more than $100,000 for a year of treatment.  Two vaccines have also shown themselves to be effective in preventing cancer: the human papillomavirus (or HPV) vaccine, which can prevent cervical cancer, and the Hepatitis B vaccine, which can help prevent liver cancer. But those vaccines work by fighting against the viruses that cause cancer, not cancer itself.  Johnston says his vaccine, if it works, would prevent a broad range of cancers from ever developing by having the immune system attack cancerous cells early. And he wants it to cost between $100 and $500 per dose, about the same as most infectious disease vaccines. To create the vaccine, Johnston and his team screened 800 dogs who had at least one of the eight cancers most often found in canines. They identified a few hundred neoepitopes that the tumors from all eight cancers had in common and used 31 to develop the vaccine. Neoepitopes are the parts of a cancer cell that the immune system can target. ""We anticipate if we vaccinate with these 31 components ahead of time, just like an infectious disease vaccine, the dog's immune system will be prepared -- pre-prepared to see a tumor and kill it,"" Johnston says.  To work, the vaccine will have to train the immune system to recognize cancer cells very early.  ""(Tumors) have stealthy devices; they have ways of suppressing the immune system. At an early stage, a tumor hasn't evolved all those capabilities, so we think we have an inherent advantage by attacking very early,"" Johnston says.   Even if the vaccine works in dogs, the team has a long road ahead to get approval for a human clinical trial. Animal testing is often unpredictable, and the vast majority of drugs tested in animals are never approved by the FDA for use in humans because they are deemed unsafe or ineffective.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/health/cancer-vaccine-dog-trial/index.html","2019-06-21T22:02:42Z","2019-06-24T15:28:47Z","2019-06-24T15:28:47Z","cnn","Bronte Lord and Jacque Smith, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190621172716-dog-cancer-vaccine-fraser-new-story-body.jpg"
"90","Fighting Ebola is hard but in the Congo mistrust and fear is making it harder","article","When Ebola first struck this city of more than a 100,000 people last September, many here didn't believe it was real.   As the disease latched onto families and spread through tightly packed neighborhoods, rumors began spreading of organ harvesting and political conspiracies, even as more people got sick and died. When the ambulances came to take people away -  they would never see them again.  ""They didn't know where they were taking them. They just thought they were going 'over there' to die,"" says Sylvestre Zongwe, a Congolese manager of primary healthcare at French NGO The Alliance for International Medical Action (Alima). So instead of going for treatment, many stayed at home and died, their bodies still highly contagious and deadly for the family members who buried them. ""Fear prevents good management of the epidemic. Fear makes it difficult to break the chain of transmission. What was needed was to break the fear,"" says Zongwe. It's this extreme mistrust, along with simmering conflict and what many responders on the ground believe has been a flawed response, that has allowed the world's second-biggest Ebola outbreak on record to continue unabated more than 10 months after the first cases were found.  Despite millions of dollars in funding, and an effective experimental vaccine, Ebola is spreading to new parts of Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces and re-infecting areas thought rid of the virus. This month, it also made the long-feared jump across the border to neighboring Uganda, though at this stage those isolated cases appear to be contained.  A conflict the world forgets Butembo's residents live at the frontier of a conflict that the world often forgets.  Hemmed in by multiple armed groups that commit repeated atrocities and harassed by the national military frequently accused of human rights abuses, they are famously and understandably distrustful of newcomers.  Earlier this year, unknown assailants destroyed Ebola treatment centers in Butembo. In April, a World Health Organization epidemiologist was killed in an attack on the University Hospital. In total there have been 130 attacks on health facilities between January and mid-May, causing four deaths and injuring 38. Because of these security concerns, the White House barred world-renowned specialists of the US-based Centers for Disease Control from setting up a base in the heart of the epidemic  (although it does have staff based in the regional capital Goma.) Similarly, Doctors Without Borders  (Medecins Sans Frontieres) closed its treatment centers in some Ebola-hit areas and retreated to Goma. Faced with an epidemic that is out of control and continued violence targeted at the response, health authorities are urgently searching for a different strategy to stop Ebola. ""During the first seven months of the epidemic we had more than 1,000 cases, now we have more than more than two thousand cases in a very short time,"" says Antoine Gauge,  a response specialist with Doctor's Without Borders (MSF). A draft internal World Bank assessment on the response from late May seen by CNN, describes the mounting shock at the rising death toll. ""Alarmed by the huge and unexpected surge in recent months in the number of new cases, a number of aid agencies and implementing partners have expressed concerns over many aspects of the response,"" it reads. It describes a response top heavy on operational costs like salaries and hazard pay. More than half of the budget for WHO's strategic response plan during that period was allotted to staff remuneration. At the same time, it also shows that WHO was 40 million dollars short of its requested funding.    ""We are absolutely outraged about how this response is going,"" one senior humanitarian official based in North Kivu told CNN, saying that WHO would be better served by letting more nimble expert teams, that cost far less, do the work.  The official refused to be named, citing fear of criticism from the WHO. Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for WHO, says the organization is committed to the people of the DRC affected by the disease and that every key aspect of the response was labor-intensive.  ""As some partners and NGOs have had to leave due to insecurity or other reasons, WHO has stepped in and absorbed their tasks,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""We owe a great deal of gratitude to the 700 brave WHO personnel who, working in partnership with the DRC Ministry of Health and hundreds of their national health workers, ensure that the response continues to operate across all vital functions, particularly when support is not immediately available from others."" Community care Alima, the French NGO, believes it has found a solution to the mistrust that has stopped people seeking treatment.  It's both hidden and in plain sight. Perched half-way up a hillside next to a school, their Ebola reception center is right inside a local clinic in the heart of the community. A thermometer and a quick consult separates incoming suspected Ebola cases from other patients. Community members were brought in and consulted at the beginning of the construction.  There are no alarming Ebola warning signs and posters. It just looks like part of the existing clinic. And that was the point: It's not a scary place, hidden away. It's in the community, as part of a system that treats all ailments.  ""As soon as we fixed our approach, the results were there,"" says Zongwe.  But to the frustration of Alima, it is the only reception center of its kind in Butembo. Plans to build more have stalled. And, while innovative, it isn't nearly enough to stem the spread.  ""This potentially could've been controlled earlier in the outbreak, when it was in a rural area, but letting it go fester underground with unknown chance of transmission, has really prolonged it, and we need to make sure we do everything we can to stamp it out now,"" says Dr. Ben Dahl, a leader of the CDC response based in Goma. Innovation in treatment means if Ebola victims are identified quickly and get to treatment centers from reception centers, hospitals, or clinics, they have a much better chance of surviving. To make treatment easier and less intimidating, Alima has developed what they call ""the cube."" Separated by a thin layer of transparent plastic, patients are able to interact more directly with doctors -- they can talk to family members who visit. All of it is an attempt to reduce the fear of Ebola and convince people to come in. Major reset During and after the devastating Ebola outbreak that spanned several countries in West Africa from 2014 to 2016 and killed more than 11,000, the WHO faced scathing criticism for acting too slowly and warning the world too late. In response, the global health agency reorganized its emergency response structure and strengthened its operations. But in this outbreak, at least according to the responders we spoke with on the frontlines of treating Ebola, it hasn't worked as planned. David Gressly, freshly appointed by the UN as an Ebola Tsar of sorts, says the Ebola emergency response has gone through a major reset in recent weeks in the wake of internal criticism and a mounting death toll. ""If the virus continues to circulate, it remains a constant threat to spread to other provinces in this country and to neighboring countries and one day it will if we don't find a way to bring it to a halt,"" says  Gressly, who previously managed the region's UN peacekeeping operations.   CDC's Dahl says that the existence of the vaccine, which while experimental has been found to be 97% effective in the Congo,  has led to complacency and the legwork of tracing patient contacts and quickly isolating them has not been done thoroughly.   ""We were very fortunate to have this vaccine. It has probably reduced some of the cases and without it, we would have a much larger number of cases,"" he says.   ""But they have not been doing the public health fundamentals of quickly following all the contacts, listing all the contacts, and isolating them as soon as it becomes symptomatic,"" he says. He says around half of cases are still unknown to the contact lists and a large number of positive cases are deaths in the communities -- from people who wouldn't trust or couldn't get to early treatment. Contact lists allow epidemiologists to ring-fence an outbreak. When a positive case of Ebola is identified, the victim is interviewed to find out who they were in contact with. All of those people get on a list and, in an effective outbreak response, they are closely monitored. To get this outbreak under control, the CDC says more than 70% of cases need to seek treatment early and upwards of 80% of cases need to be on the contact lists. Otherwise, it will continue to spread. Beaten up and stoned for taking temperatures Samuel Mutahwa was unemployed when the virus hit Butembo, but when the outbreak hit he volunteered to help. Now he plays a critical detective role of tracing contacts that could help break transmission. Armed only with a thermometer, he leads his contact tracing teams through the neighborhoods of Butembo. Twice a day for 21 days -- the maximum amount of time from time of infection to onset of symptoms --   they follow up with their list of patient contacts. Mutahwa entered the compound of a grandmother and grandson that visited a sick friend in hospital. The friend later died. ""36.8 -- she is fine,"" says Mutahwa, holding a thermometer up to the smiling woman.  But earning the trust of his own community has been a hard fought and dangerous process. In the early months, Mutahwa says that he was beaten up and stoned. ""They said they were going to kill me. But I said no, I know what I am doing. I have to save the life of my people,"" he says. Survivors part of the solution Ebola is an intimate disease that is highly contagious but only contracted through direct contact.  It attacks families and then spreads through communities -- often through so-called ""super-spreaders"" the 20% of cases that spread the disease to 80% of the people. It is often the personal choices of Ebola victims that can have an outsized impact on the transmission chain.   When the sister of Roger Mumbere Wasukundi, 17, got sick earlier this year, he says nobody wanted to believe that she had Ebola. They didn't even believe that Ebola existed.  After they buried his sister, his aunt got sick and quickly died. Roger, his mother, and his father all contracted the virus. Only Roger and his mother survived. ""I was sent to the treatment center because I didn't want to give up. They told me I could survive and I believed them. Everyone prayed for me,"" he says, sitting in his classroom in Butembo. He still dreams of being a lawyer, but the virus still affects his health, his eyes clouded by the after effects of Ebola.

"92","Longer than usual and M-shaped: CDC says 2018-19 flu season was odd but not as severe as the previous deadly season","article","Lasting 21 weeks, the 2018-19 flu season was not only the longest in a decade, it was unusually marked by two separate waves of influenza A sickness, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Thursday in a new report.   An H1N1 strain dominated during an initial surge between October through mid-February, followed by a groundswell of H3N2 activity beginning in mid-February and lasting through mid-May, the CDC said. The H3N2 strain is known to cause more severe symptoms than H1N1. The flu virus is spread when a sick person talks, sneezes or coughs. Common symptoms include fever and chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle and body aches, headaches and fatigue. Despite painful symptoms, most people will recover in less than two weeks. ""It was quite an unusual season in that we almost had two seasons within the one,"" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist on the World Health Organization's influenza vaccine advisory board and a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.  Webby, who was not involved in the CDC report, said that it's not unusual to see a wave of flu A followed by a smaller wave of flu B but that this longer-than-usual season had ""two almost similar peaks of activity"" from two strains of flu A. ""It's hard to know what to read into that: Is this an anomaly? Or is this something that's changing?"" he said, adding that other countries had unusual seasons as well. Australia had nearly year-round activity for its own 2018-19 season, even though typically its flu seasons are much like the US, with a spike in winter, Webby explained.  The 2018-19 American and Australian seasons could be ""just a couple of anomalies that we won't see again or won't see again for a number of years,"" he said. ""We're far from being able to make any conclusions there."" Moderate severity overall  Despite its length and unusual pattern, the CDC considers the season to be of only ""moderate"" severity, both overall and for each age group (children and teens, adults and older adults).  The flu caused between 37.4 million and 42.9 million illnesses in the US during the 2018-19 season; between 531,000 and 647,000 hospitalizations; and between 36,400 and 61,200 deaths, the CDC estimated.  Deaths markedly declined season over season; the 2017-18 flu season, the deadliest in four decades, topped 80,000 deaths, including 180 children. By comparison, 116 laboratory-confirmed deaths in children were caused by flu during the 2018-19 season. The 2018-19 season also had lower hospitalization rates for adults, though a similar proportion of children appeared in hospital emergency rooms with signs of illness. ""Receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences,"" wrote the authors of the CDC report, which does not estimate vaccination rates or overall effectiveness for the entire 2018-19 season.  Next year's vaccine should be better  Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said that ""preliminary assessments"" of the vaccine showed it to be ""substantially better"" against the H1N1 strain than the H3N2 strain. ""That was part of the motivation, of course, to change the H3N2 component for the coming year,"" said Schaffner, who was not involved in the CDC report.  ""The flu vaccine has been reconstituted to be a better match, particularly for the H3N2 component,"" he said. ""Given the fact that there were basically two flu seasons last year, it gives you even more reason to get vaccinated."" Webby said that the unusual double spike of the 2018-19 season speaks to the importance of getting a shot. ""The flu shot does contain all of the different viruses that we saw circulating last year,"" he said. ""It's not 100% effective. It doesn't work as we would like in everybody during every season.""  Still, the vaccine is the best and ""really the only way"" to protect yourself and your family from getting the flu or lessening the severity if you do get sick, he said.   He also noted that ""there's some suggestion that, over the course of a season, the flu shot may wane a little bit, meaning that by the end of the flu season, the immunity generated by the typical flu shot may not be as effective as it was at the beginning of the season.""  This raises some interesting questions about how best to vaccinate people, Webby said. Do we delay getting a flu shot to get better coverage near the end of the season? Or maybe we can think about getting two flu shots per season. Researchers are examining these questions, Webby said, while scientists work on developing a universal flu vaccine: a single shot to protect against all strains of flu for life. ""We can probably argue about whether getting one flu shot that's going to protect you from everything for life is realistic, but we will certainly be getting improved flu vaccines as a result of this push for the universal flu vaccination,"" said Webby, who believes that ""increased duration of immunity following vaccination"" will be discovered.  Schaffner said the ""substantial influenza season at the present time"" in Australia could be ""a harbinger for things to come here. So if you need more reason to get vaccinated, that's a good reason."" Finally, he noted that scientists have found no resistance to antiviral medications, like Tamiflu, which requires a prescription. This is something all patients but especially those with compromised immune systems, like cancer patients, and the elderly should take into consideration, he said.   ""If you get the flu, call your health care provider,"" Schaffner said. ""Treatment is available. It helps.""

"93","Summer camps are requiring children get vaccinated amid measles fears","article","Each summer, as Lauren Rutkowski and her husband Joel await the arrival of energized, sun-kissed children for their seven-week camp, the couple surveys the canoes and paddleboards, the arts and crafts, the food menus -- and every camper's vaccination records. Measles outbreaks in the United States continue to grow, rising to 1,044 cases nationwide so far this year. In response, more camp owners and the camping industry are urging families to follow vaccination policies. Some camps that require all participants to be vaccinated against measles, even if parents have religious objections, have not accepted campers who are not immunized. These efforts to prevent the measles virus from traveling to and within camps aren't in vain. Medical experts warn that the virus can quickly spread in close quarters. 'Camps have definitely taken the stand' ""It's fair to say that a lot of camps that perhaps were accepting things like religious and philosophical exemptions have made the decision not to accept those,"" said Lauren Rutkowski, the owner and director of Camp IHC in Pennsylvania, which is accredited under the American Camp Association and does not accept nonmedical exemptions. As for the camp, ""we always review medical records as they come in, and we really have been double-checking more of the international staff members' medical forms because different countries have different ways of submitting them,"" she said. What has changed, Rutkowski said, is that Camp IHC often participates in inter-camp sports activities with more than 30 other camps within Wayne County, Pennsylvania, and this year the Wayne County Camping Alliance has required all participants in inter-camp sports to disclose whether they received their measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children get two doses of the MMR vaccine: the first at 12 to 15 months and the second at 4 to 6 years old. ""That was a significant change that was made in Wayne County that I think really helps protect the families who are choosing to send their children to our camps over the course of the summer,"" Rutkowski said. ""I was really interested in finding out the Camp Alliance's position on immunizations, because it's one thing for me to ensure my community are immunized but if other camps that are coming onto my property or I'm going to theirs are not enforcing immunizations, that obviously puts my community at risk,"" she said. She added that the growing attention on preventing measles from spreading to camps reminded her of when swine flu was a concern among camp owners in 2009. That year, the H1N1 strain of swine flu infected many people -- approximately 60.8 million cases, 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths occurred in the United States, according to the CDC. ""Similar to measles, it can be left behind on door handles, elevator buttons, that kind of thing,"" Rutkowski said. ""Although camps have been dealing with an increase in adenovirus and things like that, we are ready and equipped to deal with those things with the protocols that we already have in place,"" she said. ""With things like swine flu and then now with the measles outbreak, it's stepped it up a notch and has caused camps to really look at their protocols and then maybe make some amendments -- like for example whether or not you're going to accept exemptions to immunization."" A camp's decision to accept religious or philosophical exemptions typically falls in line with what its state or city requires for schools. New York is the epicenter of the US outbreak; more than 800 people there have become sick, and New Yorkers have infected people in four other states. Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation requiring schoolchildren to be vaccinated statewide, even if parents have religious objections. In other words, the legislation removes nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements. ""So with that, especially this summer, camps have definitely taken the stand where many that previously may have accepted religious exemptions are saying, 'No not this summer. We're sorry,' "" said Susie Lupert, executive director of the American Camp Association's New York and New Jersey region. ""Camps are accepting the fact that they might be losing families over that, and some families have come back to camp and said, 'You know what, we're willing to come back this summer and get the MMR,' because they really want their child to attend camp,"" she said. A study published last year in the Journal of Pharmacy Practice previously found that the MMR vaccine was among the vaccinations required or recommended for campers by at least 80% of camps in New York. Camps that are regulated and accredited with the association do their due diligence to track medical records and make sure campers are not at a heightened risk of infectious diseases. Yet ""there are thousands and thousands of camps across this country that are unregulated -- they're not licensed; they're not keeping track of medical records; they're not doing background checks on staff -- and there's lots of loopholes for how a camp can get away with this,"" Lupert said. ""Parents need to do their research and make sure they are choosing a camp that at the minimum is regulated and that in our opinion should be accredited with our association,"" she said. What medical experts say about measles and camp On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations for health and safety practices at summer camps, recommending that before starting, all campers and staff should be up to date on their immunizations. The recommendations describe nonmedical exemptions for required immunizations as ""inappropriate"" and note that ""these exemptions should be eliminated by camps."" The recommendations are not to ""exclude"" or ""isolate"" children, ""but it's really about keeping the children safe and protected,"" said Dr. CharlRe' Slaughter-Atiemo, a pediatrician at the University of Maryland Medical System in White Plains, who was not involved in the American Academy of Pediatrics statement. She described the public health threat that the nation's measles outbreak could bring to summer camps as ""scary"" and ""a little bit dangerous."" She encouraged parents to vaccinate their children, especially if they plan to attend a camp this summer. ""For any public school, and honestly for any center-based camp or daycare, children are required to submit a vaccine record when they are applying for these programs -- and whether a program accepts them or not is obviously at their discretion,"" Slaughter-Atiemo said, referencing how some may accept philosophical or religious exemptions while others may not. ""New York, Texas, Florida, California -- all of those areas where you have a lot of people traveling internationally and going back and forth; those are the big high-risk areas,"" she said. ""So for sure in those areas, I'm sure there are a lot of camps and programs that are making it mandatory for kids to get the vaccine before being enrolled in the camp."" For now. the rules and policies relating to vaccination requirements at camps can still vary by state, county and even individual camp programs. When it comes to schools, for example, ""there's no federal laws but there are some different laws by state. Some states allow only medical exemptions. Some allow medical exemptions and then also different religious or philosophical exemptions,"" said Brittany Kmush, an assistant professor at Syracuse University in New York, who specializes in infectious diseases. She added that the measles virus can easily spread in an enclosed environment such as a sleepover summer camp.  If an infected person coughs or sneezes, the measles virus can linger infectious in the air for up to two hours, even after that infected person leaves the area. ""So it's very contagious -- a very contagious disease -- and if one child comes to a camp with the measles virus and can spread it, then it puts the other children at risk,"" Kmush said. ""You're not going to send them to summer camp without sunscreen,"" she added. ""You should probably send them with all their vaccinations too, because you want to let them have the best time that they can at camp, and if they're sick they're not going to be able to.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/health/measles-outbreak-summer-camp-vaccines/index.html","2019-06-19T08:16:39Z","2019-06-19T08:16:39Z","2019-06-19T10:48:58Z","cnn","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150210154413-vaccines-2-cfb-story-body.jpg"
"94","Richer countries have less faith in vaccines, survey finds","article","People in high-income countries have the lowest confidence in vaccines, with about 20% of those in Europe either disagreeing or being unsure of whether vaccines are safe, according to a new global survey. The Wellcome Trust, a UK medical research charity, asked more than 140,000 people ages 15 and older in more than 140 countries how they think and feel about health and science. Globally, about 8 in 10 people (79%) agreed that vaccines are safe, and 9 in 10 worldwide say their children have been vaccinated, but Wellcome said there were pockets where trust in vaccines was of concern. ""Vaccines, for example, are one of our most powerful public health tools, and we need people to have confidence in them if they are to be most effective,"" said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. ""No matter how great your idea, how exciting your new treatment or how robust your science, it must be accepted by the people who stand to benefit from it,"" he added. Once largely eradicated in many places, measles has been making a comeback globally, including in the United States, in part due to backlash against immunization among some groups. In addition to poor health infrastructure and lack of awareness, social media has made it easier for vaccine opponents to operate. France most skeptical about vaccines The survey found that Bangladesh and Rwanda had the strongest confidence in vaccines. Almost all people in both countries agree that vaccines are safe, effective and important for children. In high-income regions, however, there is less certainty about the safety of vaccines, with 72% of people in North America agreeing that vaccines are safe. In Europe, that figure is even lower: 59% in Western Europe and 40% in Eastern Europe. ""And in some of these regions, greater scientific knowledge or levels of education is actually associated with less confidence in vaccines,"" the report says. ""This suggests that putting out more scientific information, or trying to educate more people, will not be enough to change minds on this issue."" The report singled out France as having the lowest levels of trust in vaccines. One-third of its inhabitants don't agree that vaccines are safe, and one-tenth don't agree that they are important for children to have. ""The rising vaccine hesitancy in France over the past several years -- which even now includes some members of the medical community -- has helped drive vaccine coverage among some children and young adults below immunity thresholds and led to rising numbers of measles and meningococcal disease cases, "" the report says. It adds that more research is needed into the role that social media and misinformation campaigns have played in generating skepticism around vaccination. ""Anxieties and public concerns about the safety of vaccines have always existed, but the rise of social media has allowed the spread of what UNICEF calls the 'real infection of misinformation' to much wider audiences,"" the report says. Gender gap  The survey found that three-quarters of the world's population (73%) trust doctors and nurses more than anyone else for health advice. A similar number of people (72%) trust scientists. More than half of the population don't think they know much -- if anything -- about science, though men were more likely to claim greater scientific knowledge than women. Globally, 49% of men worldwide say they know ""some"" or ""a lot"" about science, compared with 38% of women. The gap was largest in Northern Europe, where 75% of men claim to know ""a lot"" or ""some"" science, compared with just 58% of women. The gap was narrowest in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/health/vaccines-attitudes-health-survey-intl/index.html","2019-06-19T04:11:02Z","2019-06-19T04:11:02Z","2019-06-19T04:11:02Z","cnn","By Katie Hunt, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502192608-measles-story-body.jpg"
"95","Traveling to Europe? Make sure your measles vaccination is up to date","article","Measles is not the souvenir you want to bring back from your once-in-a-lifetime trip to Europe this summer, but there's an increasing likelihood that could happen if your vaccinations are not up to date. Researchers who work with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are warning travelers to get their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines after a ""record high"" number of measles fatalities in Europe. The reminder, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, is not agency travel guidance like what the CDC released during the Zika outbreak in 2016.  The CDC issued a global notice in June about increasing measles outbreaks around the world, but it doesn't have a specific warning about Europe, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes wrote in an email.  The measles outbreak in Europe has been extensive. From January 2018 to June 2018, European countries saw 37 deaths, a record high since the 1990s, among 41,000 reported cases. Low vaccination rates are to blame, the new warning says. In the first two months of this year, there were 34,300 reported measles cases in the European region, including 13 measles-related deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The highest concentration of cases is in Ukraine, but the disease has also been reported in destinations such as France, Greece and Italy. Georgia, Serbia and Russia have also reported high case counts. The researchers argue that Europe is ""widely perceived as being without substantial infectious disease risks."" Many travelers may not go to a travel clinic or consult their doctor about the vaccines they need, as they typically would before visiting more exotic locations.  Measles is highly contagious. The majority of cases brought into the United States -- where 1,044 cases have been reported this year -- come from American travelers who have gone abroad, the CDC says. The CDC recommends that all children get two doses of the MMR vaccine, as it's known, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age and the second dose between 4 and 6 years of age. Children can also get the second dose earlier, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose. If you received two doses, as the CDC recommended starting in 1989, the agency says you have a 97% chance of being protected against measles. If you don't know whether you have had two doses, you can have a blood test or get vaccinated again. Although the CDC says ""this is not ideal, it is safe to repeat vaccinations."" The researchers also remind doctors to ""maintain a high degree of suspicion for measles"" and ask patients with rashes whether they have traveled to Europe or been in contact with Europeans recently.  If you need a vaccination and have a trip coming up, the CDC recommends going to your doctor at least a month before you leave. It may take that much time for your body to build up immunity, and you may need that much time to complete vaccine series.  To learn more about the risks in a particular country, check its page on the CDC website.  For France, for example, the site has an ""outbreak alert"" in red letters at the top of the page to remind people to be vaccinated against measles. There are similar notices for Italy and for the UK, but Germany does not have such a notice. The CDC also offers a travel webpage to help determine what vaccinations you need.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/health/europe-measles-travel-vaccinations/index.html","2019-06-18T17:58:31Z","2019-06-18T17:58:31Z","2019-06-18T17:58:31Z","cnn","By Jen Christensen, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502192608-measles-story-body.jpg"
"96","Ebola outbreak in Congo still not a public health emergency of international concern","article","The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo does not constitute a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization said Friday.  WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as ""an extraordinary event"" that constitutes a ""public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease"" and ""to potentially require a coordinated international response."" In announcing the decision by the committee, Dr. Preben Aavitsland, the acting chair of the emergency committee, said ""possible unintended consequences"" and risks of an emergency declaration had been ""extensively debated"" by the committee members. Possible risks include border closures and restrictions on travel and trade that could ""severely harm the economy"" in Congo, he said. ""This is not a global emergency. This is an emergency for [Congo] and it may affect neighboring countries.""  Ultimately, the committee decided there was ""potentially a lot to lose"" by declaring a public health emergency, said Aavitsland, who emphasized that funding is needed to continue efforts to contain the outbreak.  The international community must ""step up funding and strengthen support"" for preparedness in Congo and neighboring countries, he said. Crisis in a conflict zone The outbreak, which began in August, is the second largest and second deadliest on record with 2,108 total cases and 1,411 total deaths as of Thursday, according to Congo's Ministry of Health. The totals include confirmed cases and deaths that occurred earlier this week in Uganda. A 2014 outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people, according to WHO. The epicenter of the outbreak is North Kivu and Ituri provinces, among the most populous in the nation and bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, according to WHO. Health officials announced this week that the outbreak crossed the border from Congo to neighboring Uganda.   Unlike the West African outbreak, bursts of violence, burning of Ebola treatment centers abductions of of health workers have plagued the current response effort. As of May 21, there have been 131 attacks on health care personnel in Ebola-affected areas, according to WHO. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, which funds medical research, said: ""I respect the advice of the Emergency Committee but do believe a Public Health Emergency of International Concern would have been justified."" Such a declaration would have ""raised the levels of international political support which has been lacking to date, enhanced diplomatic, public health, security and logistic efforts as well as released more financial resources to support the incredibly brave and committed teams working in North Kivu."" Gwenola Seroux, emergency cell manager at Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders), said in a statement ""it is clear that the outbreak is not under control and therefore we need a better collective effort."" The medical humanitarian organization, which had been working at the epicenter alongside WHO since the start of the current outbreak, suspended some of its medical activities in March following separate attacks on its Ebola treatment centers in Butembo and Katwa earlier this year. Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law and director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Global Health Law at Georgetown University, told CNN in an email that ""the international community has lacked any sense of urgency, essentially allowing WHO's Health Emergency Department and a few NGOs to fight the Ebola battle in [Congo]. This has come with enormous risk to safety and life for first responders."" Other characteristics of the epidemic The current Ebola epidemic is caused by the most deadly strain, Zaire Ebola virus, which is the same one that affected West Africa during the 2014-2016 outbreak. Six months into that outbreak, a total 1,711 probable cases of Ebola had been reported when a public health emergency of international concern was declared on August 8, 2014, for the West Africa Ebola epidemic. Despite similarities between the two epidemics, there are important differences including the fact that long-term conflict smolders at the epicenter of the current outbreak, where at least 50 armed groups cause intermittent violence, according to WHO. For this reason, the US State Department has not allowed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to deploy staff to the epicenter. The CDC has staff in-country, at a distance from the epicenter, and does not provide information regarding location in order to protect the privacy and safety of health care professionals. The agency announced this week that it activated its emergency operations center in Atlanta to provide additional support for the outbreak response. Gostin said that  ""responders are facing intense violence along with deep community mistrust. They can't get into the hot zone due to escalating violence."" Add to that, more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, according to WHO.  As was feared and expected the outbreak was confirmed to have crossed the border this week.  Yet five sickened family members were repatriated from Uganda to Congo and no additional cases of Ebola identified in Uganda at this time, the Congo Ministry of Health stated on Thursday. Farrar said: ""The confirmation of new Ebola cases in Uganda is tragic but unfortunately not surprising.  Uganda is very well prepared... but we can expect and should plan for more cases in DRC and neighbouring countries. This epidemic is in a truly frightening phase and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.""  Still, hope comes in the form of research advancements. Experimental treatments and vaccines, which were not available during the West African outbreak, have been used in Congo -- another striking difference from the 2014 West Africa outbreak, which had no vaccines and the only treatment options had not yet been used in humans.  To date, 585 patients have recovered from the illness, and more than 133,000 vaccines have been administered, which many believe has helped limit the spread of the outbreak.  The rVSV-ZEBOV experimental vaccine, manufactured by Merck, was approved by Congo's health ministry ethics committee for use in country in May 2018; Farrar is calling for the deployment of an Ebola vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, which is still under development. In its announcement on Friday, the emergency committee recommended all at-risk countries put in place the necessary approvals for using investigational medicines and vaccines as part of their preparedness. Seroux stated that ""what is most important now if we want to gain control of this epidemic is to change the way we are dealing with it. We need to adapt our intervention to the needs and expectations of the population, to integrate Ebola activities in the local healthcare system, to engage effectively with the communities, and to further explore promising vaccinations to strengthen prevention."" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he would not hesitate to reconvene the emergency committee if needed.  ""Although the outbreak does not at this time pose a global health threat, I want to emphasise that for the affected families and communities, this outbreak is very much an emergency,"" he said. ""We also need the international community to step up its financial commitment to ending the outbreak.""","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/14/health/ebola-who-public-health-emergency-africa-intl-bn/index.html","2019-06-14T17:35:04Z","2019-06-14T18:41:53Z","2019-06-14T18:41:53Z","cnn","By Susan Scutti, CNN","health","HEALTH","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180524154744-ebola-2014-story-body.jpg"
"97","5,200 people in ICE custody quarantined for exposure to mumps or chicken pox","article","US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed 5,200 adult immigrants in quarantine after being exposed to mumps or chicken pox, a dramatic jump from just a few months ago, the agency says. ICE has recorded cases of either mumps or chicken pox in 39 immigrant detention centers nationwide, an ICE official tells CNN.  Of the 5,200 detainees in quarantine across those centers, around 4,200 are for exposure to mumps. Around 800 were exposed to chicken pox and 100 have been exposed to both. The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly warned of the toll the increasing number of migrants at the border has taken on the department. This week, Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan urged lawmakers for additional funding to assist operations, calling the crisis ""unlike anything our country has ever faced.""  RELATED: What's behind the spike in immigrants at the border In May, nearly 133,000 migrants were apprehended by Customs and Border Protection -- the majority of whom were families and unaccompanied children. Many of them turn themselves in to Border Patrol.  Just because individuals are quarantined doesn't mean they have the mumps, but they've at least been exposed to it. From September 2018 to June 13, 297 people in ICE custody had confirmed cases of mumps, proven by blood test.   There are around 52,000 single adults in ICE custody overall.  The agency has previously dealt with contagious diseases, like the measles, the flu and chicken pox, but last September was the first time the agency recorded mumps cases. It's not clear where the disease derived from or how it spread. Seventy-five percent of the immigrants coming into ICE custody come from the border, though immigrants might also interact with inmates at jails, some of which also hold immigrants.   ""I think there is heightened interest in this situation because it's the mumps, which is a new occurrence in custody, but preventing the spread of communicable disease in ICE custody is something we have demonstrated success doing,"" said Nathalie Asher, ICE executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations.  ""From an operational perspective, the impact is significant in the short and long term and will result in an increase in cohorted detainees' length of stay in detention, an inability to effect removal of eligible cohorted detainees, and postponing scheduled consular interviews for quarantined detainees,"" she added.  RELATED: Why Fort Sill and other US Army bases are used to house migrant children ICE quarantines individuals for 25 days from the last incubation period. The official said staff has also been put on alert. ""This week, the ICE Health Service Corps issued a reminder to senior field leadership reminding their staff to review vaccination records and take appropriate actions,"" the official said.    The number of detainees quarantined has jumped dramatically from earlier this year. There were 2,287 detainees in quarantine for ""exposure to a detainee with a contagious condition,"" as of March 7, ICE said.  Mumps is a contagious disease There have been 1,002 cases of the mumps reported in the United States this year as of May 24, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mumps is a disease that is caused by a virus. It is spread through saliva or mucus by coughing, sneezing or talking, and by sharing eating utensils or cups. It can also spread when an infected person touches items or surfaces that are then touched by someone else who picks up the virus. The best way to prevent mumps is with a vaccine, and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 88% effective for mumps when two doses are given, the CDC says. Outbreaks usually occur among people who have close contact with an infected person or people, such as on college campuses and among sports teams. Symptoms can appear 12 to 25 days after a person is infected and can include fever, headache, muscle aches, being tired and loss of appetite. The hallmark, though, is swollen glands under the ears that are tender. But not everyone has symptoms, especially if they are experiencing a mild case of the illness. When there is a mumps outbreak in a facility where adults are detained, the ICE Health Service Corps recommends the vaccine be given ""to detainees with known exposure to at least one laboratory-confirmed person with measles, mumps or rubella."" It's also recommended that catch-up vaccinations be given to those younger than 18. ""Our detention facilities work with local health departments and make sure they're complying with state health code and make sure that their local health department is aware of the existence of mumps in the facilities,"" said the ICE official. This week, a mumps outbreak at the Harris County jail in Houston forced staff to isolate 14 symptomatic people and quarantine a few hundred other inmates, according to officials. The news came shortly after officials announced a quarantine at the jail in Bergen County, New Jersey, because of suspected mumps cases there.   Overcrowded border facilities  DHS officials have said the sheer volume of people coming across the border is overwhelming facilities. McAleenan told lawmakers this week that the increasing number of migrants has hurt the morale of border officials and exposed them to sicknesses.  ""Their morale is impacted. They're tired. A lot of them have gotten sick. They've been exposed to flu, chicken pox, measles, mumps -- all kinds of challenges in terms of the medical care,"" McAleenan said. ""They're spending time overnight in hospitals instead of patrolling the border."" Late last month, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general released a report detailing some of the issues facing border patrol facilities amid the swell of migrant arrivals.   In particular, the IG found ""dangerous overcrowding"" and unsanitary conditions at an El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol processing facility following an unannounced inspection, according to a new report. The IG found ""standing room only conditions"" at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center, which has a maximum capacity of 125 migrants. On May 7 and 8, logs indicated that there were ""approximately 750 and 900 detainees, respectively."" ""We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets,"" the report, which was first obtained by CNN, states.

"99","Jessica Biel says she's not against vaccinations","article","Actress Jessica Biel is speaking out about her meetings with California lawmakers and anti-vaccination advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to discuss a controversial vaccine bill. ""I am not against vaccinations,"" Biel wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday. ""I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.""  SB 276, which is currently under review, is a California state bill that seeks to limit medical exemptions from vaccinations. The bill has been opposed by anti-vaccine advocates, as it effectively makes it harder for parents in the state to find a way around the strict rules that require children to receive vaccines before being enrolled in public or private elementary and secondary schools. ""My concern with #SB277 is solely regarding medical exemptions. My dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family's ability to care for their child in this state,"" Biel's post continued. ""That's why I spoke to legislators and argued against this bill. Not because I don't believe in vaccinations, but because I believe in giving doctors and the families they treat the ability to decide what's best for their patients and the ability to provide that treatment.""  Biel has one son with husband Justin Timberlake. ""Please say thank you to the courageous @jessicabiel for a busy and productive day at the California State House,"" Kennedy, chairman of the Children's Health Defense, which opposes the bill, wrote in a post on Tuesday. In another photo, Kennedy and Biel posed with Democratic Assemblymember Autumn Burke.  Biel commented on the post: ""Great meeting with both of you today.""  Kennedy called Biel ""a very effective advocate"" in an interview with The Daily Beast. ""She was very strong and very knowledgeable,"" he said.  State health officials estimate that more than 40% of the 11,500 medical exemptions expected to be requested each year would be denied under the bill, according to the Los Angeles Times. In April, the CDC confirmed the US was amid the largest measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Most cases in the United States have emerged in communities with low rates of vaccination against the virus, according to public health officials.  An earlier version of this story incorrectly described Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the chairman of the Children's Defense Fund. He is the chairman of Children's Health Defense.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/entertainment/jessica-biel-vaccines/index.html","2019-06-13T07:04:37Z","2019-06-13T20:48:43Z","2019-06-13T20:48:43Z","cnn","By Sandra Gonzalez, CNN","entertainment","ENTERTAINMENT","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190613091819-jessica-biel-lobbies-against-california-vaccination-bill-mxp-vpx-00004012-story-body.jpg"
"100","6 inmates at a New Jersey jail came down with the mumps. The entire facility is now quarantined","article","Officials at the Bergen County, New Jersey, jail are dealing with an outbreak of the mumps and have put the facility under quarantine. Six inmates have been diagnosed with the mumps, though doctors are still waiting to get back test results to confirm the diagnosis. The diagnoses were made by the facility doctor and medical staff in consultation with the NJ State Department of Health, the jail said. County Executive Jim Tedesco has put the jail in Hackensack under quarantine for a little more than three weeks. No additional inmates will be accepted into the jail. Instead they'll be sent to a jail in neighboring Hudson County. The first mumps diagnosis was made on June 8, the jail said. No staffers have shown signs of the mumps so far, and 1,000 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine have been ordered expedited to the jail.  Health officials will monitor anyone released from the jail, as well as facility staff, to ensure that symptoms do not appear, the jail said. The best way to prevent mumps is with a vaccine, and the MMR vaccine is 88% effective when two doses are given. The treatment for mumps is to reduce the symptoms, including fever, pain and swollen glands, as the virus runs its course in 10 to 12 days. There's no specific antiviral treatment, and antibiotics are not effective. It is caused by a virus As of May 24, there have been 1,002 cases of mumps reported in the US this year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mumps is a disease that is caused by a virus. It is spread through saliva or mucus by coughing, sneezing or talking, and by sharing eating utensils or cups. It can also spread when an infected person touches items or surfaces that are then touched by someone else who picks up the virus. Outbreaks usually occur among people who have close contact, such as on college campuses and among sports teams. Symptoms can appear 12 to 25 days after a person is infected and can include fever, headache, muscle aches, being tired and loss of appetite. The hallmark, though, is swollen glands under the ears that are tender. But not everyone has symptoms, especially if they are experiencing a mild case of the illness. When there is a mumps outbreak in a facility where adults are detained, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Health Service Corps recommends the vaccine be given ""to detainees with known exposure to at least one laboratory-confirmed person with measles, mumps or rubella."" It's also recommended that catch-up vaccinations be given to those younger than 18.","https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/12/us/mumps-jersey-bergen-county-jail-trnd/index.html","2019-06-12T14:47:20Z","2019-06-13T19:28:49Z","2019-06-13T19:28:49Z","cnn","By Doug Criss, CNN","us","US","https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171025051245-mumps-vaccine-file-story-body.jpg"
