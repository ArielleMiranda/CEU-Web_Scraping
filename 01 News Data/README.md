# Scraping data from news websites

#### Instructions:  

1. Download news data from any websites for a given keyword:
2. The outcome should be a dataframe
3. Apply your function to at least 3 page
4. Write function, use lapply and rbindlist

#### Notes:   
I initially wanted to scrape data from **CNN** but failed at first, so I tried **BBC** website instead. While doing BBC scraping, Misi emailed with a solution to get data from CNN, so I decided to try it as well. I'm submitting 2 works for this assignment :)

Additionally, for BBC, I originally used 'vaccine' as the search keyword, but later on created a function where any search keyword can be specified within R. This is a good practice especially since I'm new to creating functions in R. I tried also scraping BBC news about 'hong kong'.

In this repo, you will find BBC news data for 'vaccines' and 'hong kong', and CNN data for 'vaccine'.
